Cytogenetics and statistical genetics do not elucidate etiology, but new research on fetal hormonal differentiation of sexual morphology, and especially of sexually dimorphic hypothalamic differentiation offers promising leads. The sum total of the sex-differential effects of assignment and rearing on gender identity differentiation is known, through observations of hermaphrodites, to be profound. Postpubertally, homosexuality does not correlate with hormonal measures presently available or with assessments of neuroperceptual sex differences in erotic arousal. It is concluded that sexual dimorphism of brain functioning in gender identity is the end product of sequential events of critical periods, with pre- and postnatal effects interacting, and the end product being extremely durable.

After this point the latencies are constant; (c) in experiments with 2 relevant and redundant cues, Ss occasionally learn both solutions; and (d) some stimulus sequences produce a preponderance of response to 1 side in excess of that predicted by the single-hypothesis assumption.

Implicit in the design of such studies is a notion of reciprocity, i.e., that Ss will feel obligated to return benefits. The failure of such attempts to raise the level of cooperation suggests an apparent contradiction between the norm of reciprocity, which is postulated as a universal norm, and findings of the bargaining studies which show little or no reciprocity. An attempt is made to resolve such a contradiction by addressing several variables intrinsic to the particular paradigm used in the bargaining studies. A selective review of the 2 literatures suggests that such variables intrinsic to the paradigms all operate in such a way as to inhibit a norm of reciprocity, and indeed help giving in general. It is concluded that the lack of reciprocity typically found in bargaining games is not because reciprocity is inoperative, but is rather due to the paradigms normally employed for the study of cooperation and competition.

In early studies mechanical sensing devices were used while later research has exclusively employed EMG. 3 major criteria were used in evaluating research on the silent performance of language (""thinking"") tasks, leading to the following conclusions: (a) covert oral behavior significantly increases over base line; (b) increased covert oral behavior is accompanied by increased respiration rate and increased amplitude of EMGs in the preferred (writing) arm, but appears to be relatively independent of other nonoral behavior; and (c) covert oral behavior does not appear to typically increase during the performance of nonlanguage tasks. A set of 5 directly relevant findings leads to the conclusion that covert oral behavior during the silent performance of language tasks serves a language function; mediational theories, built on overt behavior, help to suggest more precisely that the covert oral response facilitates the reception of external language stimuli and the internal processing of that information. Physiological considerations indicate complex and rapid feedback loops between speech regions of the brain and the speech musculature.

Only qualitative observations are available on the functions of the chimpanzee in the other sensory modalities so that chimpanzee-human comparisons in these modalities are largely conjecture.

An analysis of the characteristics of such models permits a specification of the conditions under which the model itself will be a more valid predictor than will the man from whom it was derived. To ascertain whether such conditions are met in natural clinical decision making, data were reanalyzed from P. E. Meehl's (see 34:3) study of the judgments of 29 clinical psychologists attempting to differentiate psychotic from neurotic patients on the basis of their MMPI profiles. Results of these analyses indicate that for this diagnostic task models of the men are generally more valid than the men themselves.

(b) The reabsorption of sodium from the sweat passing through the duct generates a transductal potential in which the duct lumen is negative relative to the interstitial fluid.

If this were a required condition, practically all analyses of covariance would be invalid. The required condition is that the treatment is known a priori not to affect the covariate. The logical and mathematical ramifications of this are discussed. If the treatment does influence the covariate, the calculations are the same but extreme care must be exercised in interpreting the results. Examples are cited to show that in many cases meaningful results are obtained and an analysis of covariance is still what is required.

Implications of this analysis are: (1) perceptual independence is not a unitary concept; (2) it can be studied most effectively with experiments using orthogonal inputs; (3) when correlated stimulus inputs are used, so many underlying assumptions have to be made that it is almost impossible not to find a model which satisfies both the concept of independence and any given experimental result; (4) state independence is intimately related to process independence; and (5) search for the locus of interaction is probably a more useful approach than trying to determine whether independence exists.

Examples of the use of these procedures are given for a variety of UCS modalities. Several possible operations for generating conditioned inhibitors are reviewed: extinction following excitatory conditioning, discriminative conditioning, arrangement of a negative correlation between CS and a UCS, use of an extended CS-UCS interval, and presentation of a stimulus in conjunction with UCS termination. These operations suggest that conditioned inhibitors are not generated either by simple extinction procedures or by pairing a stimulus with UCS termination. By contrast, for both salivary and fear conditioning the other procedures do appear to generate inhibitors. Most of the procedures generating conditioned inhibitors can be described as arranging a negatively correlated CS and UCS. (2 p. ref.)

It may also prove to be a useful tool in studying the temporal requirements of the listener as he processes spoken language. Methods for the generation of time compressed speech are reviewed. Methods for the assessment of the effect of compression on word intelligibility and listening comprehension are discussed. Experiments dealing with the effect of time compression upon word intelligibility and upon the comprehensibility of connected discourse, and experiments concerned with the influence of stimulus variables, such as signal distortion, and organismic variables such as intelligence, are reviewed. The general finding that compression in time has a different effect upon the comprehensibility of connected discourse than upon word intelligibility is discussed, and a tentative explanation of this difference is offered.

The postlearning interval during which ECS produces temporally graded memory effects is very brief, probably well under 1 min. The 3rd effect of ECS is the halting of the incubation, i.e., the development over time, of a punishment-produced conditioned emotional response. In the passive avoidance learning situation, incubation disruption and memory disruption have identical behavioral consequences in that in both cases Ss tend to repeat the previously punished response. The postpunishment time course of incubation is relatively long, with maximum response suppression occurring between 1 and 4 hr. after punishment. The ECS disruption of the long-term incubation process has frequently been misinterpreted as ECS disruption of a long-term memory consolidation process. (60 ref.)

A method is outlined in which comparisons among means are planned without the restriction of orthogonality. An index is provided which is a measure of the power of a set of k comparisons relative to that of a general post hoc technique. Use of the index allows one to trade off between number of comparisons and power while holding the Type I error rate constant.

These errors are of 2 kinds: failing to identify actual suicides, and treating nonsuicides like potential suicides. The 2nd kind of error inflates the costs, and decreases the likelihood, of successful suicide prevention as the suicide rate of the target population declines. The 1st kind of error raises the cost of continuing suicide occurrence. The 3rd type of cost examined is the loss of suicides by failure of the prevention method. The cost situation might improve by (1) reducing detection errors of both kinds, (2) improving the effectiveness of prevention methods, and (3) concentrating prevention efforts on groups which have high suicide rates.

It also confirmed that the EEG is a summation of many relatively synchronized cellular membrane fluctuations, and that the membrane potential fluctuations of any one cell try to follow the EEG, although the correspondence is not always one to one (Frost & Gol, 1966, p. 517)."" (The following abstract of this article originally appeared in record 1968-10077-001.) J. L. Kennedy (see 35:2) has argued that alpha rhythm recordings are artifacts caused by the mechanical pulsation of a gel (the living brain) with different electrical potentials. Kennedy's hypothesis seemed insufficiently supported, and contradicted the consensus concerning the origin of alpha waves. Significant recent research is examined which provides strong evidence that alpha waves represent a basic cellular process probably related to excitability. It is suggested that Kennedy's phenomenon be explored further to clarify any effect it may have on standard EEG recordings.

Most studies have focused on either dyadic matrix games (with the Prisoner's Dilemma as a prototype) or triadic competitive games (with the Board Game as a prototype). Types of variables in each category are: (1) task variables matrix variations, mode of presentation, length of run, threat, and power relationships; (2) situational variables strategy variations, instructions, feedback and communication, character of opponent, and reward; and (3) personality variables general differences between Ss, family background, psychopathology, attitudes and traits, and motives. In dyadic games, level of cooperation is significantly influenced by conditions in all 3 categories. In triadic games, similarly, all 3 classes of variables influence coalition formation, strategy, and outcomes. The following problems arise: comparison of game-situations, effects of situational constraints, demand characteristics, relevance to social interaction, relevance of variables, interactional effects, and variations in group size. Strictly rational theories emphasize task (and situational) variables, in contrast to theories which emphasize perceptual, cognitive, and motivational processes (personality and situational) variables.

Computer programs provide for (1) organizing the behavioral data into frequency tables and developmental curves, (2) making analyses of variance and trends comparing groups of Ss, and (3) determining statistically the patterns of simultaneous behavior and the sequences of patterns that characterize individual Ss and groups. This treatment of a large volume of data is economically feasible. The computer programs have been generalized for application in various kinds of behavioral research. Analyses provide bases in concrete behavioral terms for deriving hypotheses about the dynamics of social behavior and development. This approach promises a more complete and developmental view of complex interactive processes. Greater sophistication in the use of computer capabilities and in the application of mathematical models and treatments can increase its effectiveness. (19 ref.)

Independently corroborated evidence is found that the acquiescence tendency is substantially correlated with 1st factor content in the MMPI. Calculations show that this correlation can account for many of the properties of the MMPI scales which other workers have attributed directly to acquiescence. In the presence of aquiescence-content correlation, a relatively small component of variation due to acquiescence has appreciable effect on (1) the psychometric characteristics of the scales, (2) the selection of items for special scales, and (3) the correlation of certain MMPI scales with independent measures of acquiescence.

The methodological problems with the research designed to test equity theory were considered. It was concluded that the data from the 2 hourly situations do not make a convincing case for the view that equity theory is needed in order to explain how people react to hourly over- and underpayment. Equity theory did appear to be useful in explaining the results of the studies concerned with piece-rate over- and underpayment. It was suggested that by including some concept of equity into the more general expectancy-theory approach the results for the piece-rate situation could best be explained.

Mourning is distinguished from grief and the relationship between them examined. Mourning is considered to represent conventional behavior as determined by the mores and customs of society. Grief comprises a stereotyped set of psychological and physiological reactions of biological origin. It is hypothesized that the adaptive function of grief is to ensure group cohesiveness in species where a social form of existence is necessary for survival. The phylogenetic and physiological evidence related to this hypothesis is reviewed, and the symptomatology of grief is examined. It is argued that discussions of grief are conspicuously rare in the psychological literature because the behavior of the bereaved is not explicable within most current models of emotion. (3 p. ref.)

Ferster's concept of ""behavioral deficit"" is discussed as the explicit theoretical framework that can most parsimoniously govern these behavior analyses and subsequent modification programs. With relatively simple and communicable methods, beneficial results have been rapidly achieved, even by nonprofessional workers. Despite some lack of experimental rigor, the evidence is interpreted as strongly supportive of a social-learning model of severely pathological behavior and an operant-training model of therapy. A simplified etiological hypothesis is offered, and the issue of generality of adaptive change is discussed. Emphasis is placed upon attentional reorientation and the acquisition of elementary ""learning strategies.

The influence of Donders' subtraction method on current theory is assessed, followed by a review of experimental findings concerned with the effects on CRT of (a) number of alternatives, (b) stimulus probability, (c) stimulus value, (d) repetition of stimulus or response, (e) stimulus discriminability, (f) stimulus-response compatibility, (g) practice, and (h) emphasis on speed vs. accuracy. A 3-state conceptualization of the central mechanisms operative during the latent period-stimulus preprocessing, stimulus categorization, and response selection-is proposed. The theories are dichotomized on the basis of the process-template matching vs. feature testing-which is assumed to underlie stimulus categorization. The analysis indicates that current theories have neglected response-selection processes and are consequently unable to account for several experimental findings. A final section deals with the relation of CRT theories to perceptual recognition theories.

Incentive theory and dissonance theory yield opposite predictions about attitudinal results of role playing which involves different incentive levels. Experimental studies in this area are reviewed, and alternative explanations are discussed. Results which appear to support dissonance theory can generally be attributed to the arousal of interfering negative affect by increasing reward levels. When opportunity for instigation of such interfering reactions is low, increased reward may lead to more effective biased scanning and thus to more attitude change. Complicating factors are noted.

The hypotheses tested do not necessarily follow from dissonance theory when the research design uses 2 levels of dissonance. The theory predicts curves of seeking and avoiding with at least quadratic components. In many experiments, the curves are treated instead as positively sloped, linear functions of dissonance. The methods used do not clearly separate seeking from avoiding. Interest in information, used as an index of both seeking and avoiding, is not necessarily an index of avoiding. Ratings, rankings, and time spent looking at information, as they have been used in dissonance research, do not allow separation of seeking and avoiding. A typical research design uses a choice between supporting and opposing information, both to create dissonance and to measure its effects. This technique creates a situation in which both dissonance and dissonance reduction would be expected prior to the choice of information. Selectivity research is concerned with seeking behavior which would also be predicted from curiosity motivation.

Edwards has charged that classical statistics, in contrast to Bayesian statistics, is always violently biased against the null hypothesis. Edwards has advised the conservative classical investigator that he should, therefore, always identify his theory with the null hypothesis, so as to minimize specious claims for theoretical support. This paper reinterprets the so-called bias in terms of differential assumptions about the nature of the alternatives which must be considered; its main purpose, however, is to point out that insensitive experiments, in contrast to sensitive ones, are always biased for, rather than against, the null hypothesis. It is this 2nd bias (which exists independently of the 1st) that prompts the conservative investigator not to identify his theory with the null hypothesis.

Various theories of this phenomenon, commonly referred to as the psychological refractory period, have been proposed. The theories have been placed into 3 categories: (a) central refractoriness theories, which postulate a refractoriness in the system following the 1st response selection; (b) preparatory state theories, which explain the delay in terms of the expectancy or readiness generated by the particular interstimulus intervals employed; and (c) single-channel theories, which assume a mechanism of limited capacity in the processing system. A review of the literature indicates that the latter theory best accounts for the available data. It is suggested that a limited capacity attention mechanism which is required for response selection may be the locus of the delay.

Similar assumptions have been made by psychophysicists to explain the results of traditional threshold measurement procedures. The interrelations between signal detectability and threshold measures are discussed in relation to psychophysical statistical decision theory, and it is shown that (a) the false positive rate should be related to the Crozier ratio C = ΔΙ/ςΔΙ, and (b) it should be possible to use responses given in the method of constant stimuli to predict the value of d' that will be assigned to a given stimulus by a signal detectability procedure.

The present effort reviews some evidence suggesting that a figural aftereffect is a simultaneous illusion: (1) Varying the intensity of the inducing figure affects the simultaneous illusion and figural aftereffect in similar ways. (2) Temporal characteristics--onset and decay--of light adaptation, of afterimages, and of figural aftereffects are considered. It is shown that they obey similar empirical equations and that the constants in those equations have similar values. (3) The argument that the use of an interocular presentation of inducing and test figures eliminates the possible influence of afterimages is reviewed.

Examining clinical and mechanical methods of both measurement and prediction provides a broadened framework that defines the several possible ""clinical"" and ""statistical"" methods, and their combinations. Applying this framework to 45 studies shows an apparent superiority for mechanical modes of both data collection and combination, and also suggests that the clinician is more likely to contribute through observation than integration.

The traditional method for determining these probabilities, criterion-group validation, involves observing the incidence of x in 1 group consisting entirely of X-types and in a 2nd group consisting entirely of Y-types. Here, equations are developed for obtaining these probabilities by observing the incidence of x in any 2 groups having different, known base rates of X-types. The validation procedure making use of these equations is termed mixed-group validation, and it is pointed out that criterion-group validation is a special (limiting) case of mixed-group validation.

Analyses of the published data using this statistical method reveal that there is a considerable amount of improvement in predictive efficiency if learning is treated in multivariate terms. An important methodological point is the finding that in classical eyelidconditioning experiments, the Ss should be matched in terms of their reflex sensitivity to light and puff.

SRL and SRRs are closely linked with sweat-gland activity, with a possible contribution from epidermal factors. Available data suggest that SPL is largely independent of sweat-gland activity and may relate to certain membrane characteristics of the epidermis. In SPR, the latency of the negative wave seems to correlate closely with the latency of the SRR; both are probably functions of the presecretory activity of sweat glands. The mechanism of the positive wave is in doubt; it is regarded by some as a secondary aspect of sweat-gland activity and by others as being of independent epidermal origin. (2 p. ref.)

Experiments are evaluated and discussed mainly in terms of their ability to eliminate as an explanation the response-bias hypothesis for differential accuracy between neutral and emotional words. In addition, following Blum, a stimulus-effect hypothesis is described and applied; all the experiments discussed require, if differences in accuracy of recognition are to be attributed to perceptual variation, converging operations to eliminate this hypothesis. It is argued as well that the search for converging operations for perceptual defense has implications for methodology in other areas of perception. (20 ref.)

To this end, studies from diverse fields, for example, group dynamics, personality, and learning, are brought together and categorized. Theoretical positions concerned with the development of liking between persons and the effects which liking has upon subsequent behavior are also examined by specifying predictions from systematic formulations and comparing them with the research data.

For MMPI responses, the effect of item content clearly overrides any tendency to develop sequential dependencies; response bias is limited to total number of True or False responses.

A conservative theorist will therefore associate his theory with the null hypothesis, while an enthusiast will not--and they may often reach conflicting conclusions, whether or not the theory is correct. No procedure can satisfactorily test the goodness of fit of a single model to data. The remedy is to compare the fit of several models to the same data.

The particular learning principles advocated by the behavior-therapy group are found to be outmoded and unable to account for evidence from laboratory studies of learning. Particularly open to criticism are: (a) the emphasis on the peripheral response, (b) the assumption that concepts taken from Pavlovian and operant conditioning can be used as explanatory principles, and (c) the use of the concept of reinforcement. The inadequate conception of learning phenomena in terms of conditioned responses and reinforcement is paralleled by an equally inadequate conception of neurosis in terms of discrete symptoms. Next, the claims put forth for the effectiveness of behavioral techniques is independently examined. The lack of control over sampling, observer biases, and the lack of control over the variety of activities that constitute behavioral therapy all argue strongly against accepting the claims of success at face value. Finally, a reformulation is offered in which the learning process is viewed as the acquisition and storage of information, emphasizing the role of central processes. (2 p. ref.)

Due to technical advances in electronics, this energy is now being used as a research tool, both by study of its emission by living organisms and also by applying it to the organism. In this paper, the nature of the energy is sketched. Then, data on fingertip detection of color, neural emission of infrared energy, the use of electron paramagnetic resonance techniques to detect neural activity, brain impedance shifts and behavior, and the influence of UHF energy on behavior are considered. It is concluded that, though these areas are in the embryonic stage of development, most are potentially of great significance in the understanding of the nervous system and behavior. (2 p. ref.)

Extraverts are poorer in GSR conditioning when relatively mild stimuli are used, but do not differ from introverts when very strong stimuli are used, making impossible the development of cortical inhibition. They are also poorer than introverts when discrimination learning is involved, facilitating the growth of inhibition.

Possible reasons for these failures to obtain positive results are discussed, including the use of data obtained under conditions of extinction, choice of the GSR as the conditioned response, use of a restricted range of stimulus intensities, and failure to ensure that S discriminates the conditioned stimulus from other background stimuli.

Formats using 4 favorable items, from which the rater chooses the items most characteristic of the person rated, prove superior to other formats. This superiority appears in validities, reliabilities, and preferences of raters using the form. Conditions under which statement indices are obtained should be as similar as possible to conditions under which the final scale will be administered. Combining FC scores with other scale scores yields better results than using either instrument alone. Ample evidence exists that more research can fruitfully be done in the area. (54 ref.)

The vast influence of the English translations (1927 and 1928) of Pavlov's 2 conditioned reflex books on American psychological systematics is fully discussed, as is also the distinctness of the Pavlov system vis-à-vis specific American systems and American psychology in general. The language barrier is shown to be a unique factor in Russo-American experimental and theoretical parallels and divergencies.

The present study explores the possibility that the neurotic triad and the psychotic triad or tetrad factors found in 4 studies derive from the existence of a methodological artifact associated with item overlap. To test this possibility, MMPI interscale common-element correlations (produced solely by item overlap) were factor analyzed. 2 of 3 factors extracted are highly similar to neurotic triad and psychotic triad or tetrad factors found for 4 samples. These 2 factors do not appear in a factor analysis of truncated (overlap items removed) MMPI scale scores. Since the overlap factors are based solely on the scale intercorrelations due to overlap items, these results appear to support Guilford's warning and open to question the legitimacy of these MMPI factors.

Attempts to operationalize the concept of ""organizational climate"" in studies of organizational behavior provide a number of methods for assessing environmental variation, and yield data relevant to hypotheses regarding the interaction of persons and environments. Methods for observing climate variation include field studies, assessments of participant's perceptions, observations of objective indices, and experimental control of organizational variables. Conditions may affect behavior by determining stimuli, by restraining freedom of response, and by rewarding and punishing behavior. Illustrative of the organizational properties meriting further study are size, structure, systems complexity, leadership pattern, and goal directions.

Similarly, the mediation-avoidance hypothesis makes predictions only concerning interrupted task recall and while it is partially consistent with indirect data, it has yet to receive direct experimental test. The need-achievement conception predicts interrupted task recall satisfactorily but is inapplicable to completed task recall or relative recall scores. ITP is considered as a source of data for a developmental conception of success-failure reactions.

Adler's insistence on the continuity of waking and sleeping thought finds support in the nature and extent of nondreaming mentation in sleep.

Despite some evidence to the contrary, connotative satiation has been demonstrated in many experiments which involve continuous fast repetition of a word for about 15 sec. Generation, the opposite of satiation, appears more likely to occur when the stimuli are meaningless, when different words are interspersed during repetition, when the repetition period is short, and when the rate of repetition is slow. Associative satiation and its cognitive effects were found to be repeatedly demonstrated. The inhibition interpretation was found basically adequate in this respect and compatible with the learning interpretation. A new interpretation of connotative satiation in terms of the theory of adaptation level was proposed, which could account for a variety of connotative effects including some evidence contrary to connotative satiation and for connotative satiation itself.

Deaf were found to perform similarly to hearing persons on tasks where verbal knowledge could have been assumed a priori to benefit the hearing. Such evidence appears to weaken a theoretical position which attributes to language a direct, general, or decisive influence on intellective development. The poorer performance of the deaf on some tasks is parsimoniously attributed to either lack of general experience which is no longer manifest by adulthood or to specific task conditions which favor linguistic habits.

Conditioning procedures were highly effective with phobic reactions, anxiety reactions, enuresis, stuttering, and tics, but disappointing with alcoholism and some sexual disorders. Cures seemed long-lasting, with remarkably little evidence of the symptom substitution predicted by psychodynamic depth theories.

In all these areas, significant correlations are found, though not as often as one might expect.

It is contended that the primary factor is better interpreted as degree of psychopathology and both social-learning theory and empirical data are presented to support this view. In brief, socially desirable behaviors are typically those which conform to group standards, and the deviant behaviors which define psychopathology are usually socially undesirable. Accordingly, the tendency for MMPI scales to load inversely to social desirability on the primary factor is a consequent of the actual inverse relationship between deviancy and social acceptability of behavior.

Increased aggressiveness produced by treatment with an androgen is suppressed by these habits but becomes evident when an injected bird is matched with a total stranger or under a highly competitive situation. Successful revolts within the peck order are related to the degree of extinction of domination or toleration between individuals. Chicks treated with gonadal hormones show similar suppression of altered aggressiveness by social inertia. The passive dominance of males over females facilitates sexual behavior. Low ranking males have their sexual activity inhibited, whereas low rank among hens augments sexual receptivity. Physiological adaptation to social stress at low levels in the dominance order is brought about by the stimulation of the pituitary-adrenal cortex axis as shown by the hypertrophy of the adrenals.

The sequential effects obtained in this situation were used to evaluate alternative adaptation-level (AL) models, involving the simplest interpretations of the theory and also special assumptions about anchoring by extreme stimuli.

The study of needs--complementary or otherwise--is not likely to be fruitful in marriage research.

Husbands and wives are spurred to action by stimuli which are not operative in their lives as bartenders and secretaries. Marriage research must specify the stimuli which are specific to spousehood.

Although these data provide substantial confirmation of the implication of the drive interpretation of MA scale that HA Ss should exhibit a higher level of performance than LA Ss, an attempt was made to ascertain what factors might be responsible for failure of the difference to occur in some studies. The major factors appeared to be small numbers of Ss and the presence of ""voluntary form"" responders in the samples.

The criticisms which can be made of this literature fall into 2 main classes. 1st, the experimental manipulations are usually so complex and the crucial variables so confounded that no valid conclusions can be drawn from the data. 2nd, a number of fundamental methodological inadequacies in the analysis of results--as, e.g., rejection of cases and faulty statistical analysis of the data--vitiate the findings. As a result, one can only say that the evidence adduced for cognitive dissonance theory is inconclusive. Suggestions are offered for the methodological improvement of studies in this area. The review concludes with the thesis that the most attractive feature of cognitive dissonance theory, its simplicity, is in actual fact a self-defeating limitation. (44 ref.)

Such studies might also suggest other interview designs besides those now being used. (31 ref.)

The effects produced by delayed auditory feedback (DAF) include prolongation of vowels, repetition of consonants, increased intensity of utterance, and other articulatory changes. The significance of individual differences in susceptibility to DAF is considered in relation to personality and physiological characteristics. The technique may prove useful in the detection of auditory malingering and has possible implications for the understanding of stammering. The discussion relates the findings to models of speech control. Methodological problems and future research needs are outlined. (74 ref.)

In the clinical area the 3 major features are: presence of an intense anxiety reaction, development of stereotyped and repetitive symptoms, and fixation of needs and emotions at an immature level. Studies of experimental neurosis reveal that acute anxiety and formation of stereotyped, repetitive symptoms are characteristic of this area as well, and related studies point to fixation as a consequence of infantile frustration.

For the marital happiness of both spouses, the husband's role performance is more crucial than that of the wife. For all marriages-both modal and unique-happiness is a function of the satisfaction of those needs and expectations which, for each individual, are specific to marriage. Thus, investigation of role-specific need dispositions is preferable to conventional approaches which deal with general personality needs. (82 ref.)

The reader will be assumed to have a general acquaintanceship with analysis-of variance techniques at an elementary level, such as could be obtained from most of the better available textbooks. The present paper will deal with the analysis of curves that result when the difference between experimental treatments involves a scaled independent variable with equal steps (or equal-logarithmic steps) between levels of the independent variable. Examples would be learning curves, extinction curves, dark adaptation curves, time-to-attain a level of dark adaptation as a function of the luminance of the preadaptation field, response rate as a function of the amount of reinforcement, etc. The procedures apply to most curves or sets of curves in which y, the dependent variable, is plotted as a function of x, the independent variable, where there are equal intervals between the values of x. It is assumed that there is random normal variation in the dependent variable at each data point with equal error variances. There may or may not be parameters expressing qualitative or quantitative variation of additional independent variables that are orthogonal to x.

The main emphasis in this summary and critique will be on current research in the area of psychological tests although other areas will be treated. Omitted here is the large volume of work in social psychology, most of which stems from the pioneering work of the Unesco Tensions Project in 1950 for which Gardner Murphy was the consultant. The orientation is still quite British, largely because the older psychologists, who could afford to go abroad for graduate training, either went to London or to Edinburgh. Three clear psychological lines are now evident: (a) pyschological testing for school use--intelligence, achievement, aptitude; (b) studies with applied problems--such as industrial fatigue, research on tests for worker selection, social psychology problems (largely via questionnaires) and tensions between social groups and classes; (c) clinical, taking the form of a preoccupation with the Rorschach and TAT. Departments of psychology are still largely under the dominance of philosophy. Statistics, in line with the cognitive emphasis from Great Britain, is much developed, particularly factor analysis. There is the ever-present tendency to look for ""quick solutions"" and, on occasion, to adapt foreign psychological techniques too uncritically.

Two methods of estimating the theoretical extent of 'accident proneness' may be derived from essentially independent assumptions. One, the analysis of variance technique, makes its assumptions concerning the sub-distributions of the obtained data. The other, the binomial correlational method, assumes a chance distribution of accidents for any subject between two periods of operation. 2. Operationally, the two methods yield identical estimates. 3. Mathematically, the identity of the methods may be shown. 4. Theoretically, many of the arguments concerning the relative merits of the two methods must become suspect. 5.

The latter included techniques of coarse normalization and also methods employing specific proportions of the samples. The short methods were found to furnish estimates of the population values as accurate as those furnished by conventional computation.

The area of ""latent learning"" is an example; with each successive experiment the theoretical picture appears to become more cloudy. The time would seem to be ripe for a clarifying review of the issues. Unfortunately Thistlethwaite's (see record 1951-06717-001) attempt is unsuccessful because he ignores certain basic issues. I shall avoid making a point by point rebuttal to his thirty-page review, but shall instead limit my comments to three major issues. The three issues are: 1. It appears flagrantly inconsistent to admit, as do Thistlethwaite and other cognitive theorists, that some reward was present during the ""no food"" trials of the California studies while simultaneously interpreting the results to indicate that reward is not necessary for learning; 2. The underlying theme of Thistlethwaite's review of latent learning data appears to be that those studies which ""demonstrate"" latent learning are sound, well-designed experiments while those that fail to provide positive evidence are ill-conceived and inappropriate to cognitive theory; and 3. One of the major conclusions drawn from the results of the initial California latent learning studies was that maze performance did not necessarily mirror maze learning.

The first of these relates to the unsettled systematic status of propaganda, including the variety of ways in which propaganda phenomena have been conceptualized. In the course of developing this topic the framework for a methodological analysis of propaganda will be presented and illustrated. This section of the paper will illustrate several efforts to establish viewpoints concerning propaganda. In so doing it will illustrate the fact that a widely accepted systematic outlook in propaganda is lacking. Conceptualizations by different writers will be reviewed and several definitions of propaganda presented and discussed. The second major topic concerns some of the more important efforts to study propaganda under experimental conditions and calls attention to some of the difficulties of such study.

Method (1) cannot analyze variation attributable to differential order of presentation of experimental treatments separately from variation occasioned by individual differences among subjects each presented with the same order. Under certain conditions such analysis is possible with method (2). With either (1) or (2), if it is desired to pool error terms derived from the several replications, the separate error variances must meet the criterion of homogeneity. In method (2), if this criterion is met for the interaction variances as well, and if such interaction does not differ significantly from general error, both estimates of error may be pooled for all replications. When, with either (1) or (2) the homogeneity of variance is not demonstrated, this is indication that the experimental technique is not reliable in that inter-replication differences are greater than may be attributed to sampling error.

(1) ""All reinforcers are trans-situational."" This may be called the ""Weak Law of Effect."" (2) ""Every increment in strength involves a trans-situational reinforcer."" The latter may be called the ""Strong Law of Effect."" When thus formulated, the Law of Effect is not circular-either in definition, or in the sense that the method of establishing the law would imply its presumption. 29-item bibliography.

Harriman;). This volume is an attempt to present the field of psychology in encyclopedic form. It consists of approximately 100 articles representing 82 contributors. Some of the articles discuss such broad subjects as Child Psychology, Emotion, Personality, or Motivation. Others--for example, Aspects of Blindness, Psychological Psychodrama and National Council of Women Psychologists--are confined to relatively narrow and specialized topics. In general, emphasis is placed upon contemporary problems, approaches, and findings, although an occasional article presents a somewhat exhaustive historical account. Some contributors attempt to give a thorough review of their topics with carefully annotated references to the literature. Many writers content themselves with general discussions in which their own interests and theories take precedence over the work of others. From the viewpoint of both subject matter and style, therefore, there is an inexcusable lack of uniformity or consistency. Evidence of inadequate editing is found in the fact that the bibliographies are presented in inconsistent formats which appear to depend upon the habits and vagaries of the individual contributors. This defect is only one of a number of symptoms. Admittedly, this is not a pleasant review. It is not intended to be. The title of this book is such as to place it almost inevitably in every college library and in the hands of many laymen who honestly desire to extend their knowledge of the field. At its best it will give students and laymen alike a mistaken notion about the nature of psychology as a science. At its worst, it will make them think they know more than they do or will make the more perspicacious of them think psychologists agree even less than they do.

L. Hull that appeared in the ""Psychological Bulletin (1944, 41, 269-286). According to the original reviewer, Sigmund Koch, ""It is one of the most important books published in psychology during the twentieth century"". This statement is followed by fourteen successive pages of unrestrained praise. The review closes with three pages of hesitant criticism. The author of this current article contends that Professor Koch's enthusiasm seems to be based upon the belief that the book states ""the entire postulate set tentatively believed to be capable of generating the major phenomena of organismic behavior"". The review itself is primarily concerned with the logical elegance of Hull's system, and Professor Koch's few criticisms deal with certain logical or mathematical in elegance. When, however, one considers the relation between Hull's system and the facts of learning which it is supposed to explain, enthusiastic praise seems out of place. This author's commentary further contends that in Hull's search for formal elegance, he has apparently ignored the work of his critics, and his book has little to offer the student who is concerned with contemporary problems in learning theory. The chief defects in his theory of learning spring from two sources, his molecular bias, and his inadequate treatment of reinforcement. This article examines Hull's treatment of them.

The writer poses two problems: (1) What is the effect of environmental changes upon group and individual modes of living? (2) What is the effect of these changes upon the level with which individuals function within the new framework of equipment and skills? It is pertinent to inquire into the nature of the environment, particularly our conceptions of it, and to examine the methods by which it can be studied. Several principles, derived from two decades of study of child psychology, are presented to show the general characteristics of the human personality. The environment can be defined in terms of: (1) resources, (2) incentives, and (3) constraints. In order to study the environment and to bring it under control, it is necessary to consider the dimensions of environment. Four dimensions are discussed: (1) quality, (2) intensity, (3) consistency, and (4) pervasiveness. The implication of these principles in relation to the measurement of intelligence, motor skills, emotion, social skills, and special skills is also presented.

The author concludes that the literature of 141 titles ""contains a decidedly larger volume of pronouncements than of reports of systematic, scientific data."" The major results of the studies on the bombings and evacuations show that children as a whole are able to face the strains of total war with a great deal of emotional hardihood and adaptibility. Those exhibiting disorders or delinquency represent a small proportion. The findings support generalizations from peacetime studies including studies of children's concepts and attitudes.

The road test is not practicable, since it is an individual test expensive in time and equipment. The Driver Information Test and the Driver Experience Inventory have the advantages of group tests. They show promise but complete data are not available. The psychophysical tests have been low in reliability and disappointing in validity.

The phenomenon is considered a fundamental type of response decrement, probably not essentially different from ""true"" learning. A review of the literature reveals a striking similarity throughout the phylogenetic range. Its appearance in lower organisms shows its independence of any particular structure. With increases in morphological organization, habituation becomes less dependent upon stimulus intensity and number of stimuli, and it is less controlled by a restricted temporal pattern of stimulation. Habituation in the vertebrate proves qualitatively no different from that in the lower forms. Indices of habituation when plotted as a function of time follow a course which is rapid at first, then progressively slower. The universality of this marks it as a distinguishing characteristic of the phenomenon. This decrement is the result of external and internal conditions. The external conditions reveal certain similarities and bases for generalization; the internal conditions are as yet an open question. Bibliography of 123 titles.

The CLT is highly reliable and possesses considerable validity in terms of the development of code speed. Relationships between code speed and education, musical instrument experience, the Seashore Test of Musical Talent, mental ability, and tests on electricity, mathematics, mechanical information, physics, etc. are mostly low but positive. Correlations between scores on the ROA and the grades on non-code courses are low but positive. Higher correlations between grades and the AGCT were found.

They are critically reviewed as to their inadequate standardization in terms of the general population. The technical obstacles which psychologists must overcome to test adults adequately are listed and discussed. A survey of the current literature on the nature of intelligence shows wide divergence, reflecting the varying objectives of intelligence testing. Likewise, an examination of the validation procedures fails to reveal precise concepts about the nature of intelligence. Factor analysis is examined as an objective method of evaluating abilities, with the conclusion that ""we may have to decide by fiat the precise directions, by means of reference tests and populations, of these group-factors or primary abilities."" Detailed discussion follows on specific problems of test construction and validation such as length of test, choice of subtests, influence of speed, role of test sophistication, age and declining scores, and the use of IQ. The author presents the hypothesis that there are two kinds of adult mental capacity: fluid, or purely general ability, and crystallized, or long established discriminatory habits. The latter determine the peaks of performance in adult life. Bibliography of 137 titles.

The studies are based on large numbers of subjects, usually in the thousands. The subjects in most studies are children, in one they are adult men, and in two college students. There is a strong suggestion of slightly lower mean intelligence for individuals born in the winter-autumn half of the year, the colder-darker months, than for individuals born in the spring-summer half of the year, the warmer-lighter months. While the difference is generally slight and in many cases well below the conventional limits of significance, it is in some cases well above these limits. Both exogenous and endogenous theories are suggested in explanation of the phenomenon.

The author says in summary that there are many indications that language is a vehicle of personality as well as thought, effective speech going hand in hand with effective personality.

The introduction discusses the Rorschach method as an emergence from the newer psychological disciplines which viewed personality as a dynamic synthesis. The review is organized around the progress toward a flexible standardization of the technique and a development of reliability and validity. Emphasis is placed upon articles which treat the method systematically and reflect research orientation. Sections are headed: administration and scoring, interpretation, reliability, validity, and evaluation. The final section comprises a discussion of the place and limitations of statistical methods in the evaluation of the technique. The popularity of clinical validation and its pit-falls are indicated. Newer supplementary methods of characterizing personality are mentioned as possible sources of validation. The problem of the future, in addition to continued standardization, is to infuse the amassed data with meaning through coordinated research.

These responses may occur spontaneously or be mediated by a set, a cognitively defined criterion, and/or an assumed Aufgabe. As a response, the affective state may be considered the product of the same determinants which produce other responses, especially motivational selection, inherited predisposition, and associative shifting. 99 references.

V. Meredith (see record 2005-11663-001) of the book Predicting the child's development (see record 1942-01250-000) by Dearborn and Rothney. Dearborn argues that the queries which are put in quotation marks in the opening sentences of Meredith's review and which unfortunately seem to have determined the tenor of the whole critique are not to be found in the book, but in a prepublication announcement of the book. To give the publishers their due, and in contradiction of the reviewer's statement, it was not announced that these questions would be answered. At any rate, it would seem proper to confine a book review to what the book has to say. Further, it is to be noted that the title of the book is not a promise or even a wish fulfillment; it is a description of the chief raison d'être of this effort as of all methodological treatises. Dearborn concludes that the fact that the substance of the book has escaped unscathed at the hands of so critical a reviewer is comforting to the authors and may be reassuring to the reader.

It cannot differentiate perfectly normal from abnormal individuals. When used with non-psychotics, unfavorable scores are indicative of maladjustment, but favorable scores do not necessarily indicate good adjustment and in some cases indicate maladjustment. In student personnel work the inventory selects those desiring advise on personal matters, cheaters, those who are independent, those who tend to withdraw, and those who tend to be leaders. It is not helpful in selecting efficient clerical workers. Occupational group differences are not entirely clear-cut. Family resemblances and social group differences are in agreement with logical expectations. The happily married are more stable and extroverted than the unhappy.

This viewpoint considers the primary quantitative data of psychology: measurement of attributes of behavioral responses or their products and of the environmental conditions under which these responses occur. Approximately 20 sets of quantitative observations made by various investigators were assembled and subjected to various types of mathematical analysis. One generalization was found that would hold for all of the data examined--a law conceived as expressing the relationship between attributes of performance and the environmental variables on which they depend. The law apparently holds in the case of all learning and practice curves, provided increases in accomplishment are shown with increases in number of trials or amount of time. It agrees with data from experiments on memory. It fits various sets of data dealing with reaction time. It gives correctly the relations which Weber's law describes incorrectly. It applies to pitch and intensity discrimination. It agrees with certain formulations of increase in intelligence with increase in age.

It is concluded that timidity or fearfulness can be validly and reliably measured. The timid rat is more active, less proficient in learning, less sexual, less aggressive, more variable, and less subject to epileptic attacks than the fearless rat. Fearless and timid strains have been established by selected breeding. The timid rats have heavier endocrines than the fearless. Although excellent measures of individual differences in aggressiveness and activity are available, relatively few studies have been oriented to the present purpose. More carefully controlled studies are needed in order to establish the genetic basis of wildness and savageness. The review includes a discussion of temperament as the ""raw stuff"" of individuality and suggests other temperamental traits which might be approached through animal experiments, as for example variability, reaction strength, docility, friendliness, and spontaneity.

The writer rejects the notion of a general hunger with a functional superstructure of appetites, and defends the following statement: ""General hunger motivation can be factored into a group of partial hungers, each varying with its own deprivation period, each varying with the chemical state of the tissues, each determined to some extent by the dietary history of the animal and varying with its own degree of approach to satiation."" The bodily basis of the appetites, so defined, is said to be the sensitization of the gustatory cells to special substances by deprivation. 75 references.

He grants that symbolic logic provides a very valuable technique for analyzing and choosing between different possible psychological postulates and for disclosing postulates which might not otherwise be thought of, but he apparently holds that symbolic logic can be safely dispensed with and omitted when the final symbolic formulation of the postulates has been decided on and translated into English. He therefore believes that the final version of any psychological theory can be adequately stated in ordinary language. The current author, like Hull himself, has come to the conclusion, however, that symbolic logic can never be completely dispensed with in any rigorously formulated psychological theory which is sufficiently complex to be of interest to psychologists.

There is special emphasis on the co-operative function of the senses, and very little attention is given to the disruptive and inhibitory effects of one sensory system upon another. Also, topics such as attention, synesthesia, distraction, etc. have been excluded. The co-operative relations of the senses are summarized under 4 headings: (1) dynamogenic intersensory effects, where stimulation in one sense modality increases sensitivity or acuity in another; (2) intersensory dependence and consonance, where there is an influence of one modality on the qualities of another modality; (3) intermodal relations in perceiving spatial qualifications; and (4) intermodal relations in perceiving other nonspecific properties of objects, such as weight. In conclusion, it is stated that there are important intersensory effects even though the sensory stimulations are not permitted to have the normal meanings. The most fruitful line of research should be the study of intersensory co-operation in the normal perception of objects.

A motion that a committee be appointed to investigate what functions psychologists should fulfill in national military organizations in times of peace and war in the interests of national defense evoked considerable discussion. It was finally passed, amended to read that the task had to do also with the preservation of peace, and with the understanding that this act did not assume that our participation in the war is inevitable.

Special attention is given the principle of simple structure, the interpretation of factors, the invariance of the factors in a test, general factors, the use of clusters in the correlation table, the treatment of the diagonal cells of the correlation matrix, the relation of factor analysis and multiple correlation, the methods of factoring the correlation matrix, the problems involved in minimizing the number of common factors, the problem of correlated primary factors, and the relation of factor analysis and sampling theory.

They note that the reader may wonder if it is McNemar's scientific self that speaks in his long critique of the Iowa studies of intelligence. Calm, impartial weighing of evidence for and against a conclusion signifies the scientific approach. But McNemar has embarked upon the mission of ""demolishing,"" ""destroying,"" and ""exploding"" the conclusions of the Iowa investigators. In analyzing data, investigators are often confronted with alternative methods of treatment. In several instances the authors choice of method has not appealed to McNemar. However, they have carried out certain of his suggestions, only to find that the ""approved"" statistical treatment did not change the major conclusions. Since most of the criticisms made by McNemar can be evaluated only by a detailed comparison with the original monographs and articles, and since this is a time-consuming task, it seems desirable to present in this article a fairly complete reply. The answer to some of the criticisms is contained in the portion of the studies to which McNemar does not allude.

Other studies are also briefly considered, and the author devotes a section to a type of statistical treatment which is common to all the IQ studies of the Iowa Child Welfare Research Station. In this critical examination of the studies on IQ changes, the author raises specific questions concerning definite methodological and statistical inadequacies. He finds much of the supposed evidence for environmental influences on the IQ to be entirely nonexistent. The author also expresses two personal opinions. First, in view of the fact that he discovered startling inadequacies in those studies reported in monographic detail and in view of the fact that it was not until the original data were secured that he was able properly to evaluate-in this case demolish-the evidence based on the orphanage preschool project, he is strongly skeptical as to the dependability of the results which have been reported all too briefly in the shorter papers. Second, if it is the responsibility of the scientist to establish, and the educator to disseminate, truths, then the scientists who have turned educators should take the responsibility for dispelling error, especially that which has been the result of their own hasty promulgation of unverified and largely invalid research results.

There is, however, a counter-current in the growing emphasis upon a ""frame of reference,"" which has to do with any context that exerts an influence upon the individual's perceptions, judgments, feelings, and actions. Diversified methodology is necessary.

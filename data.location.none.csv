Even so, one limitation to accumulating additional scientific insights into the correlates and origins of these three varieties of antisocial behavior has been the lack of an efficient self-report assessment in the public domain. The Subtypes of the Antisocial Behavior Questionnaire (STAB) was developed to address this need. Although there is already a good deal of psychometric support for the STAB, prior research has yet to examine its "" ecological"" validity. In other words, it remains unclear whether the STAB scales would predict the frequency of acting-out behaviors in daily life. The current study sought to examine this question via an electronic diary study, in which participants reported on their momentary behaviors on multiple occasions in their natural environments. Analyses revealed that each STAB scale uniquely predicted only the momentary acting-out behaviors characteristic of that scale. Such findings provide further support for the STAB as a promising self-report measure of physically aggressive, rule-breaking, and socially aggressive forms of antisocial behavior. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",Aggression; Experience sampling; Rule-breaking; Social aggression; STAB,NA,NA,"Burt, S.A., Are there meaningful etiological differences within antisocial behavior?

Box 716, 9700 AS Groningen, Netherlands","Background: Aphasia has very serious consequences for speech production and, hence, for communication in daily life. Nevertheless, in the standard diagnostic procedures and in clinical practice, analysis of speech production in daily life is usually ignored or is restricted to the scoring of one or more variables on rating scales. Many methods for describing and analysing discourse production have been developed during the last few decades, with different aims and focusing on different linguistic levels. Aims: The aim of this paper is to present a critical review of the various methods that are currently used for the analysis of spontaneous speech (""discourse"") of aphasic patients. A distinction is made between semi-spontaneous speech (description of situational pictures or story telling) and ""real"" spontaneous speech (conversations or interviews based on standardised questions). Both types of connected speech can be analysed with two types of measuring instruments: rating scales and quantified linguistic variables. The advantages and disadvantages of the measuring instruments most frequently used for pragmatic, conversational, and linguistic analyses are discussed. Special attention is paid to the (ecological) validity and reliability of the methods. Main Contribution: The general outcome of the evaluation of procedures for analysing speech production and communicative abilities is that several methods do not fulfil the requirements for reliability and validity. Other methods are extremely time-consuming or give little information on the consequences of the outcomes for clinical practice. Conclusions: None of the discussed procedures is perfect, although some are better than others. Most methods do not give indications for treatment of speech production and communicative disorders in daily life and are not suitable for determining changes in the spontaneous speech of individual patients. © 2004 Psychology Press Ltd.",NA,aphasia; clinical practice; communication disorder; daily life activity; diagnostic procedure; human; intermethod comparison; interpersonal communication; interview; linguistics; rating scale; reliability; review; speech analysis; time; treatment indication,NA,"Albert, M.L., Obler, L.K., Goodglass, H., Helm, N.A., Rubens, A., Alexander, M.P., (1981) Clinical Aspects of Dysphasia, , Wien/New York: Springer Verlag; Armstrong, E., Aphasic discourse analysis: The story so far (2000) Aphasiology, 14, pp. 875-892; Ball, M., Davies, E., Duckworth, M., Middlehurst, R., Assessing the assessments: A comparison of two clinical pragmatic profiles (1991) Journal of Communication Disorders, 24, pp. 367-379; Bastiaanse, R., Broca's aphasia: A syntactic and/or morphological disorder?

Results revealed that self-reported cognitive functioning was strongly associated with depressiye symptomatology but was only poorly related to psychometric neurocognitive performance, particularly in schizophrenia. After illness denial was controlled for, the overall association between subjective and objective test performance was slightly increased but still failed to reach significance in six out of eight analyses. In approximately 20% to 40% of all cases, clinicians judged memory performance to be normal despite substantial impairment revealed by neuropsychological test results (attention parameters: 7-51%). Since (ecological) validity and reliability have been demonstrated for many neurocognitive paradigms, the present results question the validity of non-psychometric neurocognitive assessment and call for a complementation of clinical judgment with neurocognitive assessment. Reasons for decreased sensitivity of self-reported and clinician-assessed neurocognitive functioning are discussed.

Yet we know almost nothing of the means by which alcohol enhances social experience. Importantly, since individuals in social contexts not only respond to environmental conditions, but can also actively generate these conditions, understanding alcohol's social enhancement within wholly unstructured social interaction presents challenges. To address this issue, the current study examines responses of individuals participating in a structured pleasurable experience in social context (humor presentation)—a drinking context with ecological-validity that permits us to test theories of alcohol-related social-enhancement through isolating responses to the controlled presentation of pleasurable stimuli (i.e., comedy punchlines). Participants (N = 513) were randomly-assigned to consume an alcoholic, placebo, or control beverage in the laboratory. Participants were video-recorded during presentation of a comedy routine in 3-person groups, and participants' Duchenne smiles were recorded on a frame-by-frame basis using the Facial Action Coding System. Comedy punchlines were coded by five raters and validated via an independently collected sample of participants (N = 30). Results of nested frailty survival models, controlling for the smiles of other group members, indicated a significant interaction between punchlines and alcohol in predicting smiles. Specifically, alcohol selectively increased smiling during times when no humorous stimuli were being presented, whereas there was no significant effect of alcohol on smiling in response to the humorous stimuli themselves. Findings highlight the importance of less intrinsically entertaining social moments for understanding alcohol-related social enhancement. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.",Alcohol; Emotions; Facial expressions; Humor; Social context,NA,"R01AA015773; National Institutes of Health, NIH: R01AA025969","Bitterly, T.B., Brooks, A.W., Schweitzer, M.E., Risky business: When humor increases and decreases status (2017) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 112 (3), p. 431; Cooper, M.L., Motivations for alcohol use among adolescents: Development and validation of a four-factor model (1994) Psychological Assessment, 6, pp. 117-128; Damoiseaux, J.S., Rombouts, S., Barkhof, F., Scheltens, P., Stam, C.J., Smith, S.M., Beckmann, C.F., Consistent resting-state networks across healthy subjects (2006) Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 103 (37), pp. 13848-13853; Doty, P., de Wit, H., Effect of setting on the reinforcing and subjective effects of ethanol in social drinkers (1995) Psychopharmacology, 118 (1), pp. 19-27; Ekman, P., Friesen, W.V., Hager, J.C., Facial action coding system (2002), Network Information Research Salt Lake City, UT; Ekman, P., Rosenberg, E.L., What the face reveals: Basic and applied studies of spontaneous expression using the facial action coding system (FACS) (2005), 2nd ed.

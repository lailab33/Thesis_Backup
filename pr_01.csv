Experimental evidence with 20 stat-rats shows that such preferences are not a necessary condition for the occurrence of an ORE.

The principle of primary stimulus generalization is changed from an exponential to a linear function for both habit and inhibition. The principle of stimulus interaction is substituted for the additive axiom used by Spence and for the principle of afferent neural interaction proposed by Hull. With these 2 modifications, and other principles in the theory, prediction equations are derived for several types of problems involving discrimination learning and transfer. The modified theory is shown to predict that successive, conditional reaction, and mixed simultaneous-successive problems can be learned. There is also an illustration of the way in which response-produced cues can be quantitatively incorporated into the theory. Finally, a method is described for obtaining maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters in the prediction equations. A generally favorable evaluation of the theory results from a comparison of its predictions with the outcomes of some 2 dozen experimental studies. (38 ref.)

It is argued that this molar formulation cannot be captured by networks of associations unless one allows associations to act on (other) associations. This formulation is then used as a basis for showing how rules are involved in decoding and encoding, symbol and icon reference,and higher order relationships. Decoding and encoding are shown to involve insertion into and extraction from classes, respectively. Reference is viewed in terms of rules which map equivalence classes of signs into the classes of entities denoted by these signs. Symbols are shown to involve arbitrary reference, whereas icons retain properties in common with the entities they denote. Higher order relationships are then expressed as higher order rules on rules. This is a direct generalization of associations on associations. Finally, a partial solution is posed to the problem of what (rule) is learned. Given a rule-governed class of behaviors, what is learned is defined as the class of rules which provides an accurate account of test data. Empirical evidence is presented for a simple performance hypothesis based on this definition. (38 ref.)

Each subpart has the property that it can be generated unambiguously by simple rules. Such a rule system consists of E, the set of elements or events forthcoming, and I, the set of intervals leading from 1 event to the next. Parts or their generating rule systems can be the elements of higher order rule systems. This produces the recursive E-I theory. 1 part is generated from another by any of a class of transitions such as repeating, transposing, or inverting. By applying such transitions as compound functions, one generates structural trees, which give a particularly simple account of certain regular patterns. Experimental results show that the difficulty of learning a transition within such a pattern depends on how high it is in the tree. The theoretical results are applied to the theory of music.

Amobarbital, which attenuates the behavioral effects of nonreward, selectively raises the threshold for septal driving of the hippocampal theta rhythm at this frequency. Septal driving of hippocampal theta at 7.7 Hz. applied during extinction enhances extinction; applied during acquisition it creates a ""pseudo partial reinforcement extinction effect."" Blocking the theta rhythm by high-frequency septal stimulation or medial septal lesions blocks the partial reinforcement extinction effect.

A continuum of preparedness is defined which holds that organisms are prepared to associate certain events, unprepared for some, and contraprepared for others. A review of data from the traditional learning paradigms shows that the assumption of equivalent associability is false. Examples from experiments in classical conditioning, instrumental training, discrimination training, and avoidance training support the assumption. Language acquisition and the functional autonomy of motives are also viewed using the preparedness continuum. It is speculated that the laws of learning themselves may vary with the preparedness of the organism for the association and that different physiological and cognitive mechanisms may covary with the dimension.

In a learning task involving discriminations of quantity, responses may be based on quantity alone, or the constraint between quantity and the dimensions of the material (i.e., height and breadth) may be learned as well. It is argued that learning of the latter sort would include the major features of equilibration. Such learning would render perceptual and cognitive judgments consistent with one another, and remove the conflict between them. Thus, the impediment to the adoption of a quantity criterion is removed, not when cues such as height are found to be irrelevant, but when height and breadth jointly are found to be consistent with quantity. A further reason why quantity criteria are adopted is that any combination of 2 judgments based on quantity criteria always yields the same result, whereas judgments on a single dimensional criterion such as height do not. Implications for the conditions under which conservation may be acquired are outlined. (28 ref.)

It is shown that factorial designs and analysis of variance procedures not only provide tests of the models, but also scales of the independent, stimulus variables. Next multisection (including bisection) and ratio setting tasks are considered. For these, the response is on the physical stimulus scale, and this is not in general an adequate psychological scale. However, the monotone rescaling procedure of functional measurement provides a way to get a valid scale of the dependent, response variable. A robust method for distinguishing between the log and power versions of the psychophysical law is also obtained. Finally, it is argued that the experimental base of traditional psychophysical scaling with direct, numerical response methods is inherently too narrow to support a solution to its problems. Tasks based on psychophysical information integration provide a broader and potentially simpler approach to scaling. In this approach, the psychophysical law appears as a by-product of the substantive development. (2 p. ref.)

The stages of cognitive development in Piaget's system are essentially formalized characterizations of such different forms of equilibrium. In general, Piaget's characterizations of these equilibrium forms have stemmed from his studies of the development of conservation in such ""impersonal"" categories of experience as quantity and number. A critique of S. Asch's approach to social interaction suggests, however, that the processes involved in the organization of interpersonal events are isomorphic to those involved in the organization of impersonal events. This view can be expressed in terms of an extended version of the above 2 conceptions: (a) the individual constructs his world in the form of complementary polarities which at certain levels of development are experienced as physical dimensions of the impersonal event and as role dimensions of the interpersonal event, and (b) the equilibrium relationship between polarities is a determining factor with respect to the conservation of both impersonal and interpersonal events. The present formulation attempts to delineate some of these equilibrium forms in the individual's construction of interpersonal events. (25 ref.)

Movement perception is treated as a problem of position memory: an O compares the position of an object at 1 point in time with his memory of its position earlier in time. The accuracy of this comparison appears to be limited by noise in his eye positioning system which is cumulative with time. Although involuntary eye movements are suggested as a major component of this noise, other covert components are also considered. A measure of visual movement sensitivity is defined which is independent of the O's response bias.

General algebraic expressions for the favored player's long-run payoffs under these conditions are provided as an alternative to Rapoport's numerical methods. When both players are assumed to behave rationally, standard game-theoretic methods single out mutual cooperation on the 1st trial, followed by defection on Trial n unless a mutually cooperative outcome occurred on Trial n-1, as a rational solution to PD games in which alternation strategies are unprofitable. Any other PD games reduces to a coordination game. Some suggestions are advanced for analyzing the situation when the players are allowed to change strategies at any point, and when the players are not restricted to 1st-order conditional strategies.

The results for both acquisition and retention suggest the union of 2 components, a contiguity component and a rehearsal component. The contiguity component decreases rapidly from 0-1 sec. and more slowly thereafter. Beyond 1 sec., the rehearsal component increases in a negatively accelerated fashion, compensating for the lack of S-R contiguity. A model of the interaction of these components is presented.

Primary emphasis is placed on the related areas of stimulus generalization, transposition, and discrimination learning as examples of SE. Recent evidence has indicated that the only comprehensive approach to SE, the Hull-Spence system, is inadequate to account for many phenomena in these areas. A theory of SE based on a combination of information and adaptation-level concepts is proposed as an alternative to the Hull-Spence theory. A number of investigations were conducted in order to test certain assumptions of the proposed theory. The results of these studies provide support for the approach presented in this paper. A main advantage of the proposed theory is that the use of adaptation-level concepts permits quantitative predictions when an appropriate mathematical model for the calculation of adaptation level is available. It is felt, however, that both in lieu of and in addition to quantitative predictions, that the present system has considerable heuristic value that may stimulate further research. (32 ref.)

A more appropriate procedure was devised in which a subtle reversal of the roles of S and E distracted the actual S from acquiring the problem-solving set characteristic of previous methods. This ""double-agent"" approach was established in the context of an interview. The interviewer considered himself the E, and was told that his assignment was to reinforce a particular motor response in the interviewee. The interviewee was in fact the E; he used that motor response to reinforce a particular choice of verbal prompt (to continue the interview) in the interviewer. Thereby, the double-agent interviewee (ostensibly the S, actually the E) was able to accomplish seven reversals in the relative rates of 2 of the interviewer's prompts. Frequent probing of the interviewer indicated that he was not aware of these changes in his own behavior, and that he had other irrelevant hypotheses to explain his variable apparent success in reinforcing the interviewee's motor response. Variable success in obtaining the effect across Ss may eventually be accounted for by parameters of the setting and by the S's other characteristic uses of the verbal responses chosen for study. Thus, the results indicate that verbal operant conditioning can occur without awareness in some persons, and that a person may unknowingly let his verbal behavior be controlled by another person in order to himself gain control over certain aspects of the other's behavior.

The RT for repetition was faster than for nonrepetitions, and both were decreasing linear functions of their respective conditional probabilities. The manner in which the slope and the intercepts of these linear functions are affected by changes in the number of alternatives, stimulus-response compatibility, and response-to-stimulus interval is discussed. It is also shown that the present approach not only accounts for data which had previously been described by the information hypothesis, but for results which departed from the hypothesis as well.

Both typically involve an arbitrary CS and a trial-by-trial sequence of pairings between the CS and UCS. According to 2-factor theory, the instrumental reinforcement of avoidance is based on the Pavlovian reinforcement of a drive state in the presence of the CS. It has been shown that the presence of the CS is not necessary for the occurrence of avoidance responding. A procedure in which the sole effect of the avoidance response was a reduction in the average frequency of occurrence of an aversive electric shock proved to fully adequate to maintain lever pressing in rats, thereby suggesting that not all avoidance requires 2 factors. Further experiments with various new procedures suggested that the CS may function as a discriminative stimulus for the avoidance response, rather than as a stimulus whose removal is inherently reinforcing, as 2-factor theory requires.

A storage system is proposed which has 2 different modes of activation: a temporary excitation (short-term or primary storage), and a permanent excitation (long-term or secondary storage). The storage is assumed to be organized so that access to stored information can be made directly from a sensory code. Thus, the initial interpretation of sensory events can be performed automatically, allowing attention to be directed to events on the basis of their meaning and momentary psychological pertinence. A retrieval process is described to handle the problem of deciding when an item that is recovered from storage is that which was sought. The output from storage is accepted as valid only if it can lead back naturally to the original query of memory. If it cannot, the retrieval process continues, using the initial query together with each intermediate output to guide the direction of search. (35 ref.)

A brief review of these theories and of types of masking shows that lateral inhibition may explain metacontrast, if it is assumed that inhibitory and excitatory processes develop at different rates. The specific lateral inhibition model used to make quantitative predictions is a neural network consisting of 5 2-factor neurons as developed by N. Rashevsky and H. D. Landahl. The idealization of neural response represented by these neurons is discussed. This model successfully predicts when monotonic and U shaped functions will be obtained in metacontrast interactions, and it predicts the reappearance of a masked target under conditions in which both target and mask are presented a number of times in succession. An extension of the model may account for paracontrast and other types of forward masking. Such a model promises to be quite generally applicable to temporal processing of visual stimuli. (55 ref.)

The matching-to-sample conditional discrimination-learning paradigm is presented as an analogy. In life settings, this discriminated-operant conception can account for cases of observational learning, and for the pervasiveness of generalized imitation, the focusing of it on 1 model, and its occurrence in situations where the model is absent or which there is no extrinsic reinforcement for imitation. This mechanism can also apply to imitation of more general attitudes or values, which may result in behaviors that are topographically quite different from the model's. The paper next examines the identification process by which a child is said to acquire the motives, values, and ideals of another (or others), and proposes the generalized-imitation paradigm, cued and reinforced by social stimuli, as a parsimonious basis for the phenomena usually grouped under identification.

Females surpass males on simple, overlearned, perceptual-motor tasks. Males excel on more complex tasks requiring an inhibition of immediate responses to obvious stimulus attributes in favor of responses to less obvious stimulus attributes. It is hypothesized that these sex differences reflect differences in relationships between adrenergic activating and cholinergic inhibitory neural processes, which, in turn, are sensitive to the sex hormones, androgens and estrogens. Studies of the effects of drug and hormone administrations on these behaviors, and of sex hormones on adrenergic and cholinergic neurotransmitters are examined.

In fact, many phonemes are encoded so that a single acoustic cue carries information in parallel about successive phonemic segments. This reduces the rate at which discrete sounds must be perceived, but at the price of a complex relation between cue and phoneme: cues vary greatly with context, and there are, in these cases, no commutable acoustic segments of phonemic size. Phoneme perception therefore requires a special decoder. A possible model supposes that the encoding occurs below the level of the (invariant) neuromotor commands to the articulatory muscles. The decoder may then identify phonemes by referring the incoming speech sounds to those commands.

Attitudes are classified as positive or negative depending upon whether the individual feels favorable or unfavorable toward the attitude object or object of affective significance. Cognitions (beliefs about or perceptions of relationships) are classified as positive, negative, or null depending upon whether they are perceived as working toward the formation of a unit, working against the formation of a unit, or negating positive (or negative) relations. Behavior is classified as positive or negative depending upon how the individual evaluates it. 2 objects of affective significance associated with a cognition are referred to as a cognitive band. Such cognitive bands are consistent if the product of the signs is positive and inconsistent if the product of the signs is negative. Following the same multiplicative rule the triad of behavior, cognition, and object of affective significance is consistent if the product of the signs is positive and inconsistent if the product of the signs is negative. The movement toward triadic consistency and away from triadic inconsistency can occur in 2 basic situations, attitude-belief change following behavior change and behavior change following attitude-belief change. For numerous reasons the former sequence is much more likely to produce triadic consistency than is the latter.

Texas","A hypothesis which attempts to account for extinction following partial reinforcement in terms of certain sequential aspects of nonreinforced and reinforced trials was considered. The central assumptions are that nonreinforced trials occasion a specific and distinctive internal stimulus and that this stimulus is progressively modified by successive nonreinforcements. Stimulus modification was indicated as exerting its effects on extinction through 3 sequential variables: N-length, number of different N-lengths, and number of occurrences of each N-length. The operation of these variables and the stimulus modification mechanism was elaborated by considering certain salient and representative partial reinforcement investigations. This detailed survey of critical experimental findings suggested that the better known nonsequential variables which form the basis of most current partial reinforcement hypotheses exercise little or no control over extinction and that a theory of extinction must be based on a sequential analysis. Experimental evidence was considered which suggests that: (1) the modification mechanism may be applicable to all partial reinforcement situations, whether classical or instrumental, appetitive or aversive; and (2) the present hypothesis may be able to deliver certain types of rate-of-extinction predictions. These particular rate predictions, while relatively primitive, do appear to be something of an improvement over the current greater-than type prediction. (2 p. ref.)

In addition, no experiments with Ss below the level of adult humans that have used 1 training set have revealed that the middle-size relationship can control behavior. Although most of the data were readily deduced by the ratio theory, there were results that required the assumption of precise absolute perception rather than the learning of ratios.

The highest point in the CR magnitude function is assumed to occur in fewer trials when long interstimulus intervals are used and in more trials when shorter intervals are used. UCR diminution is shown to depend upon an associative process by the device of omitting the CS and noting the increase in UCR strength thus produced. This increment has been found to be a function of the number of prior paired conditioning trials, the CS-UCS interval (in conventional fashion, with a peak at about .5 sec.), and whether a delayed or trace conditioning paradigm is used. It is suggested that the development of inhibition of delay, upon the basis of which these effects are assumed to occur, may be similar to differential or selective reinforcement (of an instrumental type) of late as compared with early responses. When the CR is made instrumental in shock avoidance, CR attenuation and UCR recovery are not observed. A study of the relationship between GSR amplitude and judged intensity of electric shock failed to provide support for the notion that this reinforcement may be due to reduced noxiousness of the UCS when late responses occur, but the issue is not closed by these results.

Measures of response used were estimation accuracy, the ability to learn class names, the ability to classify, and changes in expressed preference after differential experience with stimulus variability. In each study children at 2 grade levels and adults responded to random shapes varying from 5-40 independent turns. Results supported the following conclusions: (1) Ss are sensitive to variability, (2) there is a limit on processing ability, (3) there are systematic effects of experience with variability on expressed preference, (4) young children tend to select from the presented variability. The postulation that experience with stimulus variability just beyond the limits of processing ability would result in maximal cognitive change received partial support. (20 ref.)

The model uses judgments obtained when stimuli are presented with equal frequency to predict the judgments when stimuli are presented with unequal frequencies.

The thesis of the present research is that what is transferred from the 1st to the 2nd task in a paired-associate transfer situation is some combination of these 3 effects. Utilizing the coordinate system invented by Osgood in which all the transfer paradigms can be arranged, 3 transfer surfaces are proposed which describe how each of the 3 effects is transferred individually.

This paper describes the implications for both types of experiments of Spence's interpretation of K when that interpretation is coupled with the view that K is a function of level of deprivation.

The principle of contiguity simply states that variables more similar in their facet structure will also be more related empirically. This principle does not provide for a differentiation among facets in determining the relationship. A nonparametric approach to the differentiation problem is provided by the more general concept of semantic principal component.

A review of the literature on electroconvulsive shock (ECS) provides little, if any, support for this point of view. ECS does, however, result in retrograde amnesia (RA). If the RA is not due to disruption of a consolidation process, then what are its sources? The writers interpret the literature to mean the ECS produces an inhibition of the Pavlovian variety which follows the known laws of learning and becomes conditioned to stimuli of the ECS situation.

He then asserts that the deductions could be made on the basis of any curves that have a continuous negative slope that is steeper for avoidance than approach at each point above the abscissa. This assertion is correct; however, it is shown here that the assumption of an everywhere steeper avoidance gradient rules out exponential decay curves as gradients and, in fact, rules out all monotonically decreasing, differentiable functions which have a limiting value of 0 as distance from the goal increases.

These explanations are based mainly on observations of a trapezoidal ""window"" in rotation. The experiments reported here show that perspective effects in a trapezoidal window do not increase reversal frequencies and that other shapes in addition to a trapezoid exhibit the effect with similar frequencies. They also failed to confirm that misjudgments of orientation are a causal condition of apparent reversals. A general theory in terms of an identity of projected (retinal) motion characteristics for clockwise and anticlockwise motion is proposed with supporting evidence. This theory is sufficiently general to explain apparent reversals (fluctuations) in the orientation in depth of static figures and objects and to explain also the kinetic depth effect. All these phenomena are held to derive from an identity of retinal projections for 2 or more motions or orientations of an object in space. (17 ref.)

Persons constitute populations, hence (or, that is to say), can be randomly sampled. There are no populations of tests, items, or testing conditions, hence, no means for random sampling. Sampling in those realms is almost invariably expert selection. Psychometric methods whose derivations assume random sampling of tests, items, or testing conditions include the Q technique, classical reliability theory and its recent liberalizations, and others. These techniques seem inadequately anchored in relation either to the science of psychology or to the practice of testing. Representativeness of experimental conditions as the foundation for generalization is reaffirmed, however. Expert attention to representativeness is required precisely when randomness is unattainable. (33 ref.)

A U-shaped relationship between age and terminal level of correct response is reported, while age and simple patterns of response bear an inverted U relationship to one another. Younger Ss show a more rapid rise to terminal level of response than do older Ss. In addition, differential effects of reinforcement and non reinforcement are noted among the age groups, and differential changes occur in these effects as the task progresses. Data from a number of other studies are discussed in relation to these findings, and an attempt is made to consolidate various sources of evidence to provide support for the mechanisms which are assumed to underlie certain of the developmental changes reported.

The main concern of this paper is information reduction which, it is suggested, represents a kind of thinking in which the solution is in some way implicit in the problem, but in which the input information must be reflected in a reduced or condensed output. A number of tasks within the areas of concept identification and utilization are shown to have this character. If the tasks require complete representation of the stimulus in the response (condensation) the amount of information reduced is directly related to difficulty both during learning and in utilization of previously learned rules. If the tasks allow Ss to ignore information in the stimulus (gating) the direct relation between reduction and difficulty is found during learning but may not occur after the rule is learned.

An anlysis of these determinants and especially their relation to a trial-by-trial prediction of the S's response (a molecular psychophysics) was undertaken. The analysis suggests that the relative importance of the external and internal determinants can be assessed by measuring the consistency of Os' responses to repeated presentations of the same auditory signals. An experimental technique is introduced to measure such consistency and the results of some experiments are summarized. The results indicate that the amount of external variability is about the same as the internal variability. The implication of this result for any attempt to predict trial-by-trial behavior is discussed. (15 ref.)

Examination of the so-called sensory-interaction effects seriously questioned the validity of the afferent stimulus-interaction postulate. The postulate predicts a greater generalization fall for reaction potential to a test stimulus which differs from CS by x units on one dimension and by y units on another than to a test stimulus which differs from CS by x units on the first dimension and is identical with respect to the other dimension. Considerations from the sensory-interaction literature suggest that under some conditions the opposite is true. Results of experiments on stimulus-intensity generalization and discrimination learning were found to conflict with the predictions derived from Behavior Theory, supporting the view based on sensory-interaction effects. Treating drive (D) in terms of stimulus component (SD) and suggesting that its effects might under some circumstances be a special case of sensory-interaction effect, the equivalence of the consequences of stimulus intensity and drive intensity were examined. Experimental results supported the view proposed. An argument was advanced for an increased role of perceptual variables in Behavior Theory. (33 ref.)

Hostile aggression is assumed to be a learned drive whose primary antecedents are past exposure to punishment and present threats to self-esteen.

For this purpose 3 sources of noise are considered: spontaneous background noise, the irreducible physical variability of the stimulus, and variation in the response of the neural pathways simultaneously excited by the administration of a stimulus. It is postulated that the last will show positive correlation, i.e., that the central effects of the different elements which are simultaneously activated by a stimulus will vary from trial to trial in a similar, rather than in independent fashion. If this is accepted, a law for the Weber function can be derived which gives, for visual brightness discrimination, a square root relation at low stimulus intensities with a continuous transition to a linear law at high intensities, and which can be applied to explain some features of visual spatial and temporal summation. The model also allows Weber's law to be derived for other sensory dimensions. (2 p. ref.)

Pennsylvania","Aronfreed, J., U. Pennsylvania","The learning of self-criticism is represented as the prototype of a form of internalization in which the child replicates certain components of the punishments to which it has been previously exposed. The stimulus properties of these components, first presented in the responses of a model, attain reinforcement value when they come to operate as signals for attenuation of the child's anticipatory anxiety. The effects of a variety of experimental socialization paradigms are combined with an analysis of naturalistic socialization to illustrate the mechanisms in the acquisition of self-criticism. Some extinction paradigms are also used to examine the sources of its persistence. Both the motivating and the signalling functions of social punishment are described as being essential to its reproduction, while the rewarding characteristics of the model are seen to bear only a very tangential relationship to the phenomenon. The motivational antecedents and consequences of self-criticism are considered to be independent of the cognitive substance that defines its evaluative character. (66 ref.)

Data are presented to show that the latency of the initial GSR to the CS does change during training, contrary to their claim that it does not. After many conditioning trials, the initial GSR gradually is tranformed into a highly attenuated and delayed CR.

A major weakness of previous coding-type theories of shape recognition is remedied, in that a memory system is built into the recognizer, which becomes self-organizing in terms of stimulus regularities in the environment. This is shown to be a logical basis for perceptual learning and perceptual constancy.

In cases of hostility displacement, as others have proposed, the target evokes aggressive responses from an angered person. Aggressive cues in the angered person's thoughts or in the external situation ""activate"" an aggressive response sequence which does not attain completion until the anger instigator is injured. Preventing the completion of the activated sequence heightens the arousal state and this (a) increases the strength of any subsequent aggressive responses, (b) raises the level of tension experienced by the person. Completing the ongoing aggressive sequence by inflicting injury often leads, in the absence of guilt or anxiety, to a pleasurable reduction in the experienced tension. (33 ref.)

Smith regarding conditioning under curare. Smith has presented ""reservations"" (see record 1964-05542-001) concerning the appropriate theoretical interpretation of some recent data on conditioning under curare (Black, Carlson, and Solomon, 1962; Solomon and Turner, 1962). These data show, first of all, that Pavlovian conditioning of cardiac, pupillary, and exophthalmic responses occurs in curarized subjects, and secondly, that such conditioning affects subsequent behavior (both autonomic and skeletal) in the normal state. These data were interpreted as indicating that conditioning in curarized subjects ""provides evidence to support the position that autonomic conditioning does occur independently of skeletal activity"" (Black, Carlson, & Solomon, 1962, p. 25). We do not agree with these contentions. In our previous experiments we defined a skeletal response as an overt response; that is, one which was observable by the experimenter in the intact organism. Conditioning of autonomic responses and transfer occurred when skeletal responses, so defined, were prevented. A more stringent operational definition of a skeletal response is provided by the electrical activity recorded from the muscle. We have made observations using this approach as well, recording muscle potentials (EMG) and cardiac responses concomitantly in curarized dogs. A brief description of these experiments follows. Muscle potentials in experimentally naive dogs were recorded from subcutaneous needle electrodes feeding into EEG preamplifiers on a Grass Polygraph. Four locations were used. The CS was a 4,000-cycle tone; the UCS an electric shock. The CS-UCS interval was 10 seconds, and the shock duration S seconds. A delayed conditioning procedure was employed. The resulting data seem to support further the hypothesis that cardiac conditioned responses can occur in curarized dogs when skeletal activity, as defined by change in EMG level, is prevented. Our available evidence suggests that skeletal activity in curarized subjects does not occur closely correlated in time with cardiac conditioned responses.

If in addition we assume that the apparent distance between 2 points is measured in the nervous system by summing the excitability of the elements between them, then distortions of phenomenal space will occur around previously excited points.

Fear motivation is defined as motivation to avoid a negative incentive or punishment, hope motivation as motivation to approach a positive incentive or reward, motivational relief as reduction in fear motivation following nonconfirmation or partial confirmation of an expectation of punishment, and motivational disappointment as reduction in hope motivation following nonconfirmation or partial confirmation of an expectation of reward. This alternative conceptualization makes a clear distinction between congnitive expectations and hope and fear motivation in that an expectation is assumed to be a necessary but not a sufficient condition of motivation.

The evidence indicates there is some underlying generality in moral behavior although there is still much of the variance of the honesty tests due to specific test determinants.

The major problem of this paper was to determine whether any of the proposed mechanisms, or a combination of them, are sufficient to account for the varied effects of punishment on behavior. A systematic examination of the data led to the conclusions that if an aversive stimulus is contingent upon a response there will be greater suppression (or less facilitation) of the response than if the aversive stimulus is not contingent upon the response, but that the aversive stimulus itself, may result in response facilitation under some conditions and response suppression in others.

The tools of Bayesian statistics include the theory of specific distributions and the principle of stable estimation, which specifies when actual prior opinions may be satisfactorily approximated by a uniform distribution. A common feature of many classical significance tests is that a sharp null hypothesis is compared with a diffuse alternative hypothesis. Often evidence which, for a Bayesian statistician, strikingly supports the null hypothesis leads to rejection of that hypothesis by standard classical procedures. The likelihood principle emphasized in Bayesian statistics implies, among other things, that the rules governing when data collection stops are irrelevant to data interpretation. It is entirely appropriate to collect data until a point has been proven or disproven, or until the data collector runs out of time, money, or patience. (71 ref.)

M. Broverman on the effects of score transformations in Q and R factor analysis techniques. In this article, Broverman claims to have presented ""new arguments and empirical evidence of important differences not previously recognized between the two techniques as they are commonly employed."" These differences are said to include ""differences in results, differences in the type of inference possible from the results, and consequently differences in the theoretical implications of the data""--in a word, ""differences...of the greatest magnitude for research in psychology."" The present note is intended to demonstrate that the differences Broverman obtained from his Q and R factor analyses do not constitute the empirical warrant for such claims. It will be shown that when Broverman's own data are reanalyzed and the appropriate comparisons are made, a clear and understandable relationship emerges between the results of Q and R factor analyses ""as they are commonly employed."" It is our contention that this result is actually due to a peculiarity of Broverman's chosen method of factor extraction. Specifically, as Broverman (1961) himself has noted, Tryson's method of cumulative cluster analysis ""proceeds directly to an approximate simple structure solution"" (p. 69). That is, the factors extracted by this method already are rotated. Our task then is to demonstrate the consequences of using rotated rather than unrotated factors. We submit that while ""ipsative"" scores may have their place in certain inquiries, Broverman is in error in construing bipolarity per se as substantive grounds either for his proposed theory of ""choice point"" or for any other.

A neural mechanism based on the differential sensitivity of these cells to specific aspects of stimulation, with cells exhibiting a differential rate of maturation paralleling the maturation of certain behavior, is developed. It is hypothesized that this mechanism is responsible for onset of the imprinting critical period, inborn preferential choice responses, innate object recognition, and the stimulus-specific releasing function involved in fixed action patterns. Evidence supporting the neural model is presented, and specific examples of relevant behavior are explained in terms of the model.

It is demonstrated that one cannot logically separate stimulus generalization and response generalization in such a matrix. Hence, a decision about which type of generalization occurs is equivalent to a restriction of one's attention to either rows or columns of the matrix.

MacAndrew and E. Forgy regarding the effects of score transformations on Q and R factor analysis techniques. MacAndrew and Forgy have pointed out that factors obtained from ipsative scores are related to unrotated residual factors obtained from raw data. This observation is correct, but oversimplified. For instance, in a matrix containing several ipsative factors, the distribution of the subjects' means may correlate with a particular ipsative within-individual factor; the ipsative factor analysis solution would not correspond precisely to the unrotated residual factors obtained from the original matrix. Also, the magnitudes of loadings on the two types of factors need not be similar for the following reason: The total possible communality within a given matrix of scores is fixed. I have no fundamental disagreement with the statistical observations made by MacAndrew and Forgy. We do, however, differ considerably in the meaningfulness and importance attached to factors obtained from g free, ipsative or residual variances. Thus, even where bipolarity is neither tenable nor desirable as an attribute of cognitive theory, I believe an ipsative analysis might be profitably employed. MacAndrew and Forgy's note serves a useful function in clarifying the mathematical relationships between results obtained from ipsative versus raw data scores. Demonstration of mathematical relationships between different results, however, does not eliminate the differences.

The present article points out that while this position could be defended in Fisher's approach to testing statistical hypotheses, it could not in the Neyman-Pearson approach or on more general scientific grounds. It is emphasized that one optimally designs experiments with enough sensitivity for rejecting poor theories and accepting useful theories, whether acceptance or rejection of the null hypothesis leads to empirical support. The argument that, in the procedure to which Grant objects, an insensitive experiment is more likely to lead to support for a theory is shown to be only a special case of the argument against bad experimentation.

In 35 rats (34 females, 1 male), we have produced bilateral lateral hypothalamic lesions of varying sizes using a standard stereotaxic technique (Stellar & Krause, 1954). The coordinates used were: A 6.0, RL 2.0, and 8.0 down from the dural surface. By offering the animals a variety of wet and palatable foods in addition to the ordinary dry Purina laboratory chow pellets and water, and by keeping them alive by tube-feeding if necessary, we have identified four clear-cut stages in the recovery from lateral hypothalamic lesions: Aphagia and Adipsia; Anorexia and Adipsia; Adipsia with a Secondary Dehydration-Aphagia; and Recovery. The stages always follow the same sequence and are defined by critical behavioral events that occur in succession during the recovery process.

Scores for several responses are summed or averaged to give a composite score. Examples would include some of the methods of absolute judgment in psychophysics, the Likert-type of attitude scale, Osgood's semantic differential, rating scales used in personality assessment. The object of measurement for the composite scores may thus be some attribute of physical stimuli, of verbal concepts, of other persons, or of oneself. Two components can be distinguished in the responses: (a) the direction from the neutral point, representing the basic dichotomy-heavy versus light, agreement versus disagreement with the statement, etc.; (b) the degree or extremeness of the response from the neutral point. For example, in a six-point Likert scale the subject writes + 1, + 2, + 3; or - 1, - 2, - 3 to indicate slight, moderate, and strong agreement or slight, moderate, and strong disagreement. The basic dichotomy of direction is determined by whether he agrees or disagrees (writes + or -); extremeness by whether he indicates slight, moderate, or strong feelings (writes 1, 2, or 3). A neutral response category may or may not be provided-e.g., Likert scales traditionally permitted a neutral response (writing 0), but many recent Likert scales do not. When scores for several responses are summed or averaged to give a composite score, the two components become: the number (more generally, the proportion) of responses scored in each direction; the mean extremeness of the responses in each direction. The present paper derives a method for estimating the relative contribution of these two components to composite scores, and applies the method to data from several Likert attitude scales.

The purpose of this paper is to examine the content, merits, and limitations of such an approach. The discussion will focus on two closely related matters. The first is the idea of a set of functions relating subjective to objective probability. The second is whether or not the subjective probabilities of a set of mutually exclusive events, one of which must happen, should add up to one. The paper begins by denning two classes of decision theories. After some preliminary discussion of utility and subjective probability functions, it next considers the class of theories which result when subjective probabilities are assumed to add up to one. This class turns out to have some serious difficulties. A brief review of experimental evidence provides empirical reasons for avoiding these difficulties by rejecting additivity. Then the paper examines models which do not require subjective probabilities to add up to one.

The histological studies lead to the conclusion that nerve fibers supplying hairy skin terminate as bare, unencapsulated filaments in relation to three types of tissue: undifferentiated epithelial cells of the dermis and lower layers of the epidermis, hair follicles, and smooth muscle elements of the cutaneous blood vessels. Nafe (1934, 1942) has proposed that these bare filaments are essentially alike and hence respond to a common adequate stimulus, namely, movement either in relation to them- selves or to the surrounding tissue. These terminals differ primarily in that they terminate in different tissues of the skin. Both tactile and thermal sensations result when tissue is moved, the former by the direct action of a mechanical stimulus on the tissue, and the latter, by movement of the thermally labile smooth muscle, especially of the arterioles.

In each of these studies the higher anxiety (drive) group was initially superior, but became inferior in later learning trials. These results have been replicated by Lovaas (1960b) using levels of dynamometer tension to induce drive differences. A study by Malmo and Amsel (1948) also shows a decrement at the end of training, when high and low anxiety groups are compared. In Hullian learning theory, increased drive should facilitate the performance of the strongest response in a response hierarchy. However, there is considerable experimental evidence that, while moderate drive increases tend to facilitate performance, high drive is related to decrease performance of a previously dominant response. It was suggested that these findings could be handled within the Hullian framework by the use of a lower reaction potential ceiling than that originally suggested by Hull. The additional utility of the reaction potential ceiling in accounting for some clinical phenomena was then discussed.

The theories referred to are those which present models of discrimination learning in probabilistic terms. Such theories are abstract, and abstractness in the sense of generality is usually held to be desirable in a scientific theory; however, abstractness defeats its own purpose if it leads to ambiguity of interpretation on the one hand, or neglect of some of the facts which a theory should explain on the other. (The two dangers are, of course, related.) That both these dangers exist for theories of discrimination learning will be demonstrated, and possible moves for overcoming them suggested. The Schwerpunkt of the discussion will be the topic of shape discrimination, because the difficulties for discrimination learning theories are here particularly acute, and because possible solutions to the problems involved have already been proposed.

In essence, Thompson assumes that only I√ is developed in rewarded subjects while both I√ and I∑ are assumed to occur in nonrewarded animals. The development and dissipation of I√ follow a simple negative growth function of time; I∑ dissipates very slowly over time and may be generalized to similar stimuli. The theory is applied to the alternation situation and to the phenomena of extinction, reminiscence, and spontaneous recovery. The present note bears only on the theory as it applies to alternation. Its purpose is to point out some features of Thompson's (1960b) system which are highly questionable in light of existing data.

These authors have shown that the relation between category rating scales and direct magnitude scales is nonlinear. Other psychologists who have agreed with this latter point have suggested that the differential discriminability or confusability of the stimuli be used in conjunction with the category values to generate a scale (Messick & Abelson, 1957). We shall refer to this kind of scale as a ""processed category"" scale. The point that Messick and Abelson make is that if the category scale values are determined by a (Thurstonian) model that allows unequal stimulus dispersions and category widths, as in data processing by the method of successive intervals (Gulliksen, 1954; Torgerson, 1958), the nonlinearity may disappear.

The particular feature of the theory that was of greatest interest to the authors was the promise of solving an old problem in the field of psychophysics. This is the problem of controlling or specifying the criterion that the observer uses in making a perceptual judgment. This paper begins with a brief review of the theory of statistical decision and then presents a description of the elements of the theory of signal detection appropriate to human observers. Following this, the results of some experimental tests of the applicability of the theory to the detection of visual signals are described. The paper also contains a description of the theory, an account of a previously reported experiment, and the results of four other experiments. The authors believe that the article brings together all of the data collected to date in vision experiments that bear directly on the value of the theory.

The purpose of this paper is to summarize and discuss some of these investigations, to attempt a solution to certain of their apparent inconsistencies, and to proceed further along the path suggested by earlier findings. Findings regarding the structure of interpersonal behavior, reported by various investigators and dealing with different types of groups and ratings, are reviewed. These findings suggest a circumplex structure around the two orthogonal axes of Dominance-Submission and Love-Hostility. It is shown that two axes are sufficient for describing the empirical results, but not for explaining them. A new, fuller, facet structure is developed to account for the empirical findings. Some characteristics and implications of this structure are examined.

Distributed practice (DP) is when trial intervals are greater than 15 seconds; massed practice (MP), when intervals are 2-8 seconds. DP enhances learning when a minimal level of interference occurs during response acquisition, since this allows successive extinctions of error tendencies. Under MP, errors are suppressed rather than extinguished. Amount of interference and length of interval are the critical variables; the latter must be shortened as the former increases in order for facilitation to occur. MP causes no impediment when there is interference in associating the stimulus with the response term.

When the drive condition was generalized emotional D rather than incentive oriented set, a high drive group did better than a low drive group on an intentional task, but no difference was found between the 2 groups on an incidental task. Incentive-oriented tasks may elicit goal-directed responses without energizing other responses that are irrelevant to the goal. Generalized D, on the other hand, (such as anxiety), intensifies all reaction tendencies in a given situation both relevant and irrelevant to the central task; this would have the effect of overcoming a funneling or focusing of attention to relevant cues by intensifying the relatively weaker habit strength to irrelevant cues in a high drive group.

Is word value related, in a general sense, to word frequency? 2. If a general relation between value and frequency exists, does it exist because more positively valued words are used more frequently or because one increases positive affect merely by increasing frequency? Or does the dependent-independent relationship depend on the experimental procedure used? 3. Are there significant differences in visual duration threshold between ""good"" and ""bad"" words of equal population-wide frequency? Are there significant differences between frequent and infrequent words equal in affective tone? Three positions may be taken concerning the relation between word value and word frequency, and the relation of each of these to visual duration thresh old. Two of these points of view would suggest a general relation to exist between word frequency and word value. Three experiments demonstrate the existence of this relationship. The more frequent a word or a nonsense syllable occurs in the English language, the better it is likely to be rated on the good-bad scale of the semantic differential. Since this relation does exist, we attempted to test out, in Experiment IV, one possible explanation of why the relation exists. A manipulation of the frequency of nonsense words produces systematic variation in the rated goodness of these nonsense words. Words that are frequent are also very likely to be rated as good. Hence, to separate out the influence of word value and of word frequency on visual duration threshold, we tachistoscopically presented lists of words matched in frequency, varying in goodness; matched in goodness, varying in frequency. Subjects reported the good words at significantly lower thresholds than the matched bad words; the frequent words at significantly lower thresholds than matched infrequent words. Both frequency and value appear to operate in producing differential visual duration thresholds for words. Possible explanations and certain implications of these findings were discussed.

The magnitude of each stimulus is taken as the log value of its physical energy. Computational procedures for obtaining the distinctiveness values are given. The validity of the distinctiveness scale is tested by determining the accuracy of its prediction of identification in the method of absolute judgment, and the measure is found valid with this criterion (6 studies). Evidence is presented that the proposed scale can predict the shape of the bowed serial position curve and that a log function is superior to a power function for the scale. 25 refs.

Evaluation of H strength at successive stages of learning shows that Hs follow regular functions. Predictions from the model agree well with experimental data. Some discrepancies indicate that some H may be still missing in the model or that assumptions must be changed. The central property of the model is the use of H as dependent variable unit which is defined as a pattern of responses to selected stimuli. This pattern is susceptible to reinforcement and extinction. The empirical data indicate that different Hs may not extinguish at the same time. (15 ref.)

The important question debated is not if it should be used, but rather when it should be used. Kimmel (1957; see record 1959-03845-001) has recently attempted to resolve the controversy by suggesting criteria for the use of one-tailed tests. He maintains that one-tailed tests may be used when results in the opposite direction: (a) will not be used to determine any new course of behavior, (b) will be psychologically meaningless, or (c) cannot be deduced by any psychological theory, while an outcome in the expected direction can. It is these last two instances that will be dealt with in this paper. The current author suggests that the criteria of theoretical predictability and psychological meaninglessness are not as decisive as they may appear to be. He argues that the decision to use a one-tailed test should be made in light of the difficulties with which the investigator is confronted when the results occur in the ""unexpected"" direction.

It is as though there is a continuum from the less sensitive skin areas, through the most sensitive, to the cochlea, the critical factors being the number of nerve endings and the interneural connections available.

In the second experiment with reward first favoring one goal box and then reversed, using relative number of responses made to each alternative during the first complete alternation cycle during extinction as a measure of the relative strengths of the competing response tendencies developed during learning, the recency model predicted significantly better than chance, while the frequency model predicted no better than chance.

Lack of perceptual readiness can be rectified by relearning the categories, or by constant close inspection of events and objects. Sensory stimuli are ""sorted"" to appropriate categories by searching for and using cues. 4 mechanisms are proposed: ""grouping and integration, access ordering, match-mismatch signal utilization, and gating.""

An analysis of the current evidence suggests that the classical Ebbinghaus curve of forgetting is primarily a function of interference from materials learned previously in the laboratory. When this source of interference is removed, forgetting decreases from about 75 per cent over 24 hours to about 25 per cent. This latter figure can be reduced by a least 10 per cent by other methodological considerations, leaving 15 per cent as an estimate of the forgetting over 24 hours. This estimate will vary somewhat as a function of intratask similarity, distributed practice, and with very low meaningful material. But the overall evidence suggests that similarity with other material and situational similarity are by far the most critical factors in forgetting. Such evidence is consonant with a general interference theory, although the details of such a theory were not presented here.""

In general, the plan of the argument was to demonstrate that the assumptions of initial perceptual and motor random processes were incompatible with the fact of learned adaptive behaviors.

It is held that Postman's position leaves him with the problem of whether perceptual learning is a change in the attachment of responses to stimuli or an increase in the specificity of responses to stimuli.

Topics discussed are: origins in philosophy and theology, early scientific uses, the anti-instinct revolt, current thought in psychology, genes and behavior, the meaning of genetical determination, and the ontogeny of behavior. The author concludes that when the methods of analysis that he proposes are applied to the various types of behavior called instinctive, the concept will disappear, to be replaced by scientifically valid and useful explanations. 30 references.

The discussion is built around four questions: (1) Do nonperceptual reactions become conditioned? (2) Do perceptual reactions become conditioned? (3) What is the course of conditioning when the relation between the two reactions, in addition to the perception of each reaction individually, is clearly perceived? (4) May mere conditioning give rise to new- and novel-perceptions? The major conclusion concerning the differences between perceptual and non-perceptual learning is that the division can best be obtained on the basis of the presence or absence of perceived relations between stimuli and reactions involved in learning. 64 references.

Evidence is presented from facial expression studies which indicates that the whole range of such expressions can be described in terms of a circular surface with pleasantness-unpleasantness and attention-rejection as axes, with level of activation as a possible third dimension.

The stimuli which come immediately before the punished response are paired by the response itself with the ensuing punishment.

The formulation lends itself to precise quantitative statement and may be useful for interpreting certain phenomena of discrimination learning. 22 references.

Like habit, meaning is a purely empirical construct. Meanings are postulated to increase as a simple linear function of the number of S-multiple R connections established in an organism's history. A word list of 96 dissyllables was presented to a sample of 119 USAF recruits. Defining meaning operationally in terms of mean frequency of written associations made within a 60-second time interval, a psychological performance scale of m-values is developed.

The visual field does not depend upon conditions of stimulation so much as upon attitude. Size constancy experiments with reduced cues to distance permit the 0 to see an object as either small or large depending on whether the 0 adopts a ""perspective"" attitude. Size constancy depends on an invariant of retinal stimulation consisting of a retinal area and a set of distance stimuli. An operational definition of the visual field must be stated in terms of response to stimulation and not in terms of stimulation alone. Boring's support of a distinction between sensation and perception is denied and it is proposed that an experimental source of perception start with an investigation of all the discriminable properties and qualities of visual experience.

Theories are necessary if any other situation or measures are employed if we are to avoid a complex collection of isolated laws. Two types of quantitative theories have been developed, the neurophysiological and the intervening variable types. Both of these can be distinguished from a third type which concerns itself with the nature of reinforcement. Psychologists readily accept attempts to formulate mathematical theories on neural foundations but are reluctant to accept intervening variable theories because they appear ad hoc. Properly formed intervening variable theories escape this critiscism by testing hypotheses in new situations.

Sooner or later in the course of their empirical investigations, they are forced to use a set of judges to classify some qualitative material. The material to be categorized is usually either responses to some particular stimulus context or else the context itself. This whole area of investigation has been dealt with in communications research and projective test analysis under the name of content analysis. Content analysis may be defined more generally as ""a research technique for the objective, systematic and quantitative description of human behavior, particularly linguistic."" As defined in this way content analysis applies to a large class of qualitative overt behavior: behavior of individuals in group situations, overt behavior in individual situations, the content of communications, responses from projective tests, content of motion pictures, protocols from group discussions, etc. In short, almost any time a psychologist wishes to describe or use a dependent or independent variable that he cannot measure with an objective instrument, he is forced to use pooled judgments. This area is replete with problems, primarily because the data it is dealing with are very inexact and open to a multitude of interpretations. These interpretations in turn mainly depend on a sound personality theory. There are other problems involved in this technique, however, which do not depend upon such a theory. These have to do with the traditional considerations of reliability.

Two contradictory points of view (Wundtian structuralism, and Gestalt phenomenalism) are contrasted in connection with the paradox, the ""Leipzig"" school holding that the object is seen small but is known to be big, the ""Berlin"" group holding the reverse. An eclectic compromise is suggested in that size constancy might be a consequent of sufficient clues for distance and lack of constancy a function of the reduction of such clues. Gibson's concepts of visual field and visual world are criticized as insufficiently specific and incapable of resolving the paradox. The visual field (Gibson) is equated in part with a system of reduced vision or reduced perceptions in which, because of the lack of clues an observer is dependent upon one or a few stimulus parameters which functions as observed invariances.

VTE is not a special form of behavior occurring in a discrimination situation, but is simply a succession of the incomplete and preparatory responses seen when animals are learning to respond to a situation which does not call for a choice. Deductions from this hypothesis are confirmed by data presented from the behavior of rats in a learning situation involving no choice between alternative responses.

They ignore the fact that processes of modification in paramecium and rat cannot be qualitatively identical because the two animals are anatomically quite dissimilar.

A study of the effects of personal values and frequency of usage upon both the perceptual thresholds and the recall of verbal stimuli indicates that personal values are a significant variable in each case, that frequency of word usage is a much more important determiner of preceptual recognition than of recall. Response probability is not a basic psychological variable which will advance general cognitive theory. The influence of directive factors such as the variable of personal values serves to emphasize the manner in which motivational and cognitive variables interlock in the analysis of behavior.

Simultaneously with his work in clinical psychology, Smith maintained a very extensive interest in general and theoretical psychology. He also had a number of publications.

Learning can take place without the reduction of primary needs, but always is correlated with the reduction of some measure of central neural excitation or drive. From this point of view it follows that learning is always preceded by drive-reduction; it is unnecessary to handle primary and secondary reinforcement as different phenomena; and delayed reward learning can be accounted for by assuming ""that reduction of a powerful drive has a reinforcing effect upon synapses, and that the effect is greater the more recently the synapses have been in action."" 40 references.

Extensive data are reviewed with respect to the learning by monkeys and children of object-quality discriminations, right-position discriminations, and alternations of the two. Although the children tended to develop learning set somewhat more rapidly, both children and monkeys showed a progressive acquisition of set for the solution of a given type of problem or alternation of two types. For trials after the first one (necessary to indicate the type of problem), performance eventually became nearly perfect. The seriously brain-damaged monkey developed sets which allowed him to behave more efficiently than the untrained, non-brain-damaged monkey. Implications are pointed out with respect to neo-behaviorism, field theory, stimulus generalization, socialization of behavior, brain-damage, and the effects of age on behavior efficiency.

The conditions which favor (cognitive) narrow strip-maps and which favor broad comprehensive maps in rats and in men are considered. Narrow strip-maps seem to be indicated by (1) a damaged brain, (2) an inadequate arrangement of environmentally presented cues, (3) a surplus of repetitions on the original trained-on path, and (4) the presence of too strongly frustrating conditions. The fourth point is elaborated. It is contended that some of the psychological mechanisms which clinical psychologists and other students of personality have uncovered as factors underlying many individual and social maladjustments can be interpreted ""as narrowings of our cognitive maps due to too strong motivations or to too intense frustrations.""

The greater consistency and ease of identification of traits in the intellectual aspects of behavior as compared with the emotional aspects illustrate the greater cultural standardization of activities in the former. Comparison of factor patterns among subjects differing in age, education, occupation, sex, cultural grouping, and species will contribute toward an understanding of the conditions under which traits develop. This presents a fruitful field for future research. The experimental manipulation of behavior organization through the interpolation of relevant controlled activities is a more direct approach.

The distinction is between constructs which merely abstract the empirical relationships and those contructs which are hypothetical. Concepts of the first sort are identifiable by: the statement of the concept contains only words reducible to empirical laws; validity of the empirical law is both ""necessary and sufficient for the 'correctness' of the statements about the concept""; and the ""quantitative expression of the concept can be obtained without mediate inference by suitable groupings of terms in the quantitative empirical laws."" But concepts of the second sort do not fulfill these 3 conditions. In the interest of clarity it is proposed that the phrase ""intervening variable"" be restricted to concepts of the first kind, and that the phrase ""hypothetical construct"" be used for those of the second kind. The only rule for proper intervening variables is that of convenience. But hypothetical constructs have a cognitive, factual reference in addition to the empirical data which constitute their support.

Apparently psychologists have outgrown the stage of schools. A few methodological principles, exemplified in the work of certain psychologists who owe a heavy historical debt to the earlier school of behaviorism, are formulated. After discussing the behavior scientist's conception of the nature of psychological events, consideration is given to the nature of the concepts he employs to record and to describe these events. In general, present day behavioristic psychologists tend to concentrate their energies on two classes of laws: Type 1 laws are laws of association of behavior properties. Much use is made of the coefficient of correlation. Type 2 laws may be concerned with either present environment or with past environmental events. These psychologists tend to favor use of the molar rather than molecular concepts. The theoretical framework of the behavioristic psychologist is as yet only in a very primitive state of development. 21 references.

The Thurstone psychological quantification technique is considered to be fertile in yielding data from which such laws may be formulated. The authors purpose is to present evidence of the consistency of this quantificational methodology and its deliverances with relevant known facts and principles. The reaction latencies at the limit of learning of a group of 59 albino rats were converted into momentary reaction potentials. Various statistical analyses of the data led to the following conclusions: The paired comparison procedure when pooled for many subjects results in a characteristic deviation (leptokurtic distribution) from the normal probability integral. The two distributions are sufficiently similar for the normal table, in conjunction with Thrustone's method of its use, to yield an empirical probability table. This can be used to produce what purports to be a true quantification of momentary reaction potential from leptokurtic paired comparison data. Such quantification leads to a molar law of primitive learning which, in conjunction with other empirical circumstances makes possible the quantitative statement of 7 other behavior functions.

This is a marked contrast with the state of affairs 25 years ago when there was an offensive against the concept of inherited patterns of behavior. It is suggested that this anti-heredity movement was primarily the violent reaction against the presentation of the topic by William McDougall. The term instinct was all put purged from the psychological vocabulary. Nevertheless many important studies on innate behavior have appeared during the past 25 years. But there is a great dearth of material on the genetics of behavior patterns. There is, however, evidence from genetics for the inheritance of glandular behavior. It is important in considering the role of heredity in the determination of behavior to distinghish between inheritance of receptors, etc. which may indirectly affect behavior and the inheritance of neural patterns which directly control behavior.

Hoarding in rats is innate and emotional adaptation assists hoarding behavior. The causes of hoarding are considered: low environmental temperature induces hoarding, as does food deprevation. Little or nothing is known of the physiological factors which may be the immediate cause of hoarding. Hoarding is increased by past experience of food deprivation and by frustration in attempts to get food. A rat hoards just to hoard--not to accumulate a certain amount of material. Only food is hoarded, and hoarding is done only in home cage. Familiar odor makes cage seem most like home. Light in home cage depresses hoarding while lighting of alleys increases hoarding. 17 references.

The applications of several existing theories (primary and secondary growth, etc.) to ""selected post-rest motor performance phenomena"" is discussed. No one seems adequate to account for all particular phenomena noted. But several of the variables mentioned are potentially useful. An attempt is made at isolation and definition of variables.

These are habit strength and drive which combine to produce reaction potential. Even so, there is no common method of measurement or quantification of reaction potential, and no common unit. This may account largely for the present relative lack of quantitative systematization in the behavior sciences. Probably the reason for this is that reaction potential is a condition hidden within the behaving organism, and its existence is indicated in so many different ways. It is possible that these quantitative indicators are monotonically related to reaction potential. With this and other assumptions in mind, a sample quantification is presented.

It is suggested that an attempt should be made to apply an analogous method to social problems. Discussion is concerned with phenomenology in the psychology of perception, implicit assumptions in social psychological thinking, and sample problems for a social phenomenology. It is noted that the phenomenological method in social psychology can never be more than an approach to a scientific inquiry. The immediate need is for improved methods of observation.

The designs that have been used in studies of motivation, of symbol and hence of the foundations of moral behavior, are not ""sufficiently iconic with our subject matter.

An analysis is made of Lashley and Wade's criticism of primary stimulus generalization experiments. Examination of the literature indicates that primary generalization is complete early in the conditioning process; with continued reinforcement of the conditioned stimulus, a downward sloping gradient of primary stimulus generalization gradually and spontaneously develops; ""this generalization gradient of reaction strength is a monotonic decreasing function of the magnitude of the differences between the conditioned stimulus and the unconditioned stimuli;"" primary stimulus generalized conditioned reaction tendencies are more susceptible to experimental extinction than are reactions actually conditioned to the response; systematic reinforcement of the conditioned stimulus, while systematically extinguishing one or more generalized stimuli, steepens the primary stimulus generalization gradient; ""stimulus intensity as such has a marked tendency to evoke reactions in the stimulus generalization situation;"" evidence from several sources indicates that differential reinforcement with simultaneous stimulus contrast critically involving the dimension in question is not a necessary precondition of primary stimulus generalization. 21 references.

Conditioning is considered to be independent of reinforcement, and to be complete in one trial when S and R are simultaneous. ""Rate of conditioning is made a negatively accelerated decreasing function of the time separating S and R."" Effective habit strength is related to the range of absolute stimulus intensities as well as to the gradient of stimulus generalization. It is held that response to stimulation involves an intervening variable, the surrogate response. It is also held that drives in general, and the food drive in particular, are mediated by subcortical neural mechanisms under chemical influence.

For Rice, interests are the key to learning, but they themselves are the product of past satisfaction or dissatisfaction. Mowrer considers that interests are reducible to the familiar drive mechanisms and attendant symbolic core-responses. For Rice, effect is a primary law of learning, for Mowrer it is the sole law. Allport holds that ""the vagueness that must result from extending the principle of satisfaction to cover all phenomena of learning... is such as to disqualify it as a 'law'."" At the adult human level, satisfaction is at best a cue of quite secondary importance. ""Its effectiveness depends on other more important conditions of learning.

Evidence indicates that anthropoid fears of inert, mutilated, or dismembered bodies are spontaneous. Evidently these fears are not determined by a sensory event alone. The behavior is intelligible only on the assumption that its control is a joint product of sensory and autonomous central processes. An adequate hypothesis of fear must utilize physiological concepts of cerebral action in addition to psychological terminology. The hypothesis proposes that ""fear originates in the disruption of temporally and spatially organized cerebral activities; that fear is distinct from other emotions by the nature of the processes tending to restore equilibrium."" The sources of fear involve conflict, sensory deficit, or constitutional change. 43 references.

The author's interpretations are added. Emphasis is placed upon specificity of practice gains. 24 references.

The war has brought no novel developments but rather an adaptation and refinement of techniques already available. The most prominent trend has been development of screen tests for use in neuropsychiatric selection. These are paper-and-pencil tests of the inventory type and have proved remarkably successful. Two of the most successful tests are the Personal Inventory (PI) and the Cornell Selectee Index. They detect 50 to 90% of the neuropsychiatrically unfit at a cost of from 3 to 25% of false-positives. This represents greater success than in civilian situations and is one of the outstanding contributions in the war work. The degrees to which several other tests (Rorschach, Minnesota Multiphasic, etc.) were found useful or adequate are discussed. The psychological test should not be substituted for the clinical interview, but one should supplement the other. The stress upon speed and upon classification at the expense of therapy has been limiting, but even so the development of military clinical testing has had a healthy growth and should stimulate postwar clinical psychology.

The discussion is based upon accumulated diary records of chimpanzees, descriptions of individual animals, and records of behavior.

(4) Organization is the process by which energy becomes structured and mobilized as behavior.

Attention is given to certain attitudes with certain methodological considerations. This leads to the specific task--to find the more essential criteria which can be detected in any attitude. Definitions indicate that this is a functional state of readiness. After listing several criteria of attitudes, it is pointed out that ""this approach to the problem of attitudes renders meaningless various attempts to classify them."" The psychology of values is involved in the psychology of attitudes. Data from the experimental laboratory indicate that all attitudinal reactions are judgmental activities. The authors' approach towards the psychology of attitudes places emphasis upon perceptual and judgmental processes. In developing this argument, it is concluded that the selectivity of attitudes is basically imbedded in the selectivity of perception. ""A frame of reference is involved in perceptual and judgmental activity,"" and the psychology of these perceptual frames is basically related to the psychology of attitudes. Frames of reference in relation to structured and unstructured stimulus situations are discussed. Experimental data are cited to illustrate the formation of a frame in an unstructured situation.

Perhaps the most important distinction concerns reactive ego-functions as opposed to active ego-functions which find full expression in participant activity. Participation, as opposed to peripheral motor activity, taps central valves. In studying participation the psychologist has an approach to the complete person. By focusing upon problems of participation, social psychology can advance democracy. Skills learned by psychologists during this war are well designed to forward this purpose.

Altruism is not derived from egoism, but the two are coeval and as old as life itself. Egoism and altruism have their roots in two life activities: perservation of the individual and perpetuation of the race. Thus certain features of man's altruism can be understood properly only by following the long and singular course of its evolution.

All other cognitive responses are approximations to or modifications of this form. (2) The distinctive cognitive response in humans is concerned with attainment of concepts and is a modified form of perception of objects.

Fundamentally, speech behavior is a series of movements in which certain uniformities can be found.

The linguistic response-type is defined as any uniformity in speech behavior which exhibits a certain behavioral structure. This common behavioral structure is characterized in some detail. Employing the qualifications listed, one can separate linguistic from nonlinguistic behavior. The former includes all speech behavior as well as many nonvocal gestures. Psychological properties of linguistic response-types are to be studied in terms of their strength. Thus verbal behavior ""is seen as a series of movements patterned in overlapping units.

Furthermore, collective behavior should not be made synonymous with organized group behavior. (2) Collective behavior is not necessarily face-to-face. (3) Collective behavior is not synonymous with social interaction. (4) Interstimulation and interresponse (interaction) precede collective behavior.

Perhaps nothing causes war generally, but each war is of unique origin. To avoid generalization based on a too narrow field of fact, it is probably better to study war and peace together rather than war alone. A contrast is drawn between the region of frequent violence and the region of infrequent violence. Communal ties are weaker in the former regions. These weaker psychic ties ""go hand in hand with readiness for physical conflict."" Since the communal ties are stronger in peaceful regions, these social ties are not only restraints to conflict but give goal and pattern to action.

This makes it possible to classify within the syndrome. The following analogies are suggested as aids in a holistic technique of classification: levels of magnification in which parts are seen in relation to the whole, concept of syndrome concentration in which correlational data may be used, and the extent of interrelatedness within the organism. Analysis of an example suggests the basis of low positive relationships between syndromes. In considering personality syndromes and behavior the author states that ""each act tends to be an expression of the whole integrated personality,"" especially in emergency situations. It is held that holistic theory gives specific responses (occurring where solutions are easy or habitual) their true importance and their true value.

Eight main conceptions of the ego are summarized: the ego as knower, as object of knowledge, as primitive selfishness, as dominance-drive, as a passive organization of mental processes, as a 'fighter for ends,' as a behavioral system, and as the subjective organization of culture. It is considered that these eight uses have something in common. To support this view experimental evidence is cited under the headings: generality and specificity, judgment, memory, frame of reference, learning, motivation, the level of aspiration, and industrial psychology. Properties of the ego are outlined. In discussing psychology during the war and after, it is emphasized that ""the psychology that treats the non-ego involved functions of the human organism has developed to a point of immediate utility, whereas the psychology of the 'central' regions of personality has not."" The author concludes that ""we may safely predict that ego-psychology in the twentieth century will flourish increasingly.""

The field theory cannot be called a theory in the usual sense for it can hardly be called correct or incorrect. ""Field theory is probably best characterized as a method: namely, a method of analyzing causal relations and of building scientific constructs."" In discussing the principle of contemporaneity and the effect of past and future, it is emphasized that any behavior or any change in a psychological field depends only upon the psychological field at that time. To determine the properties of a field at a given time, one may base one's statement on conclusions from history, or one may use diagnostic tests of the present. The latter has been employed extensively in psychology. Nevertheless, psychologists need to take into account a certain time period which depends upon the scope of the situation. The psychological past and the psychological future are simultaneous parts of the psychological field existing at a given time.

Arguments and data are presented. Examination of the perceptual learning postulate and the pathgoal postulate indicate that the Tolman-Lewin interpretation is operationally meaningful. Operational definitions of the key terms, knowledge and need, demonstrate that the view of Tolman and Lewin is rigorous. Since their interpretation requires no more postulates than the S-R principle of reinforcement and since it provides a greater number of valid predictions, it is economical. Citations reveal that their interpretation has been established experimentally. Although it is admitted that critics of Tolman and Lewin may be partly correct, it should be recognized exactly how the proponents of reinforcement have departed from common sense, and without recognizing the wholesomeness of Tolman's and Lewin's emphasis.

The Review was designed to be more representative of psychology than the American Journal of Psychology had been. In the same year, the Psychological Index, an adjunct of the Review, was started. Psychological Monographs, an offspring of the Review, appeared in 1895. The editorial partnership came to an end in 1903, and Baldwin became the sole editor. He was joined by Warren in 1904, when both also founded the Psychological Bulletin. Warren became the sole owner of the journals in 1910. In 1916 the Journal of experimental Psychology was started. In 1925 Warren sold the journals to the APA at original cost, and then cancelled one-third of that cost. Langfeld became editor of the Review in 1934. In the first 49 volumes there were 1434 articles. Since 1916 few experimental articles have appeared. Throughout its history the Review has had distinguished contributors and has reflected the chief psychological interest of the time. Among the types of subject matter covered are systems, emotions, learning, eye-movements, instinct, organization of intelligence, visual space, and auditory theory.

Many new technical terms have come in, while others retain the same meaning. Psychology in 1892 had 50 years or so of respectable antecedents. There is considerable continuity in content of texts from 1842 to 1942. Hall, Ladd, James, and Cattell, first 4 presidents of the APA, were active in promoting experimental psychology. Soon the trend was definitely toward experiments and measurement. Of these founding fathers, Cattell was least disappointed in accomplishments. But Woodworth notes that ""there is really much more reason to be proud than over-modest regarding the achievements of American psychology."" This is manifested by contributions is sense perception, learning, conditioning, child development, and testing. Trends in each decade from 1892-1942 are outlined.

The implication for a theory of motives is that there is no point in drawing up a list of basic drives, since these are only limited contexts.

But these criteria fail to hold up under recent experiments of the author, with free-choice situations, and of others who found variability to occur without any previous experience of the goal and without rational basis. The author presents an alternative non-purposivistic explanation. Systematic behavior invariably occurs in free-choice and 'insoluble' situations but is typically absent from 'soluble' situations. Hence it can occur in linear situations only when the opportunity for organized learning is absent. A re-evaluation of Krechevsky's 'hypotheses' experiments, including those on decorticated and maze-dull rats, shows that systematic responses cannot be considered solution attempts. Repetition of a choice-point response is always an adjustment to an individual unit, not to a unified series. The rejection of the 'hypotheses' concept does not necessitate a return to crude atomism in learning theory.

He next applies this to an interpretation of two opposite sorts of social movement, the kind resulting from frustration, typified by Nazi Germany, with its regression from a complex to a primitive civilization, its senseless aggressive destructive tendencies, and blind following of a leader, versus the democratic or goal motivated kind, typified by complexity of goals, criticism of its leaders, and a constructive program.

The genesis of impulse, desire, purpose, motive, and consciousness is through blocking or conflict among habits. Habits are dynamic, persistent, learned, selective, and purposive. (2) Character is the interpenetration of habits. The self is a complex Gestalt of habits. (3) Impulse is the dynamic phase of habit. (4) Emotion is perturbation from the clash or failure of habit. (5) Motive is an impulse viewed as a constituent of habit. (6) Desire is activity surging forward to break through obstacles. (7) Thought is the mode of organic behavior in which past experience, as habit, controls the present course of behavior in fulfilling some desire or purpose. (8) Mind is a way in which organisms behave on the basis of past experience. It is not private and subjective, but is known through experimental observation. (9) Consciousness is either bare immediacy or awareness of meaning, having ideas. (10) Meanings are ways of viewing things in the interests of action. The chief criticism of Dewey's system is against (1) the ambiguity in using such terms as meaning, mind, consciousness, as consisting wholly of organic responses, (2) the concept of habit as fundamental to psychology, and (3) employment of popular concepts in technical applications.

Semiotic has three branches: syntactics, semantics, and pragmatics, which are concerned with the relation between a sign and other signs, its referent, and the user of that sign respectively. An experiment amounts to the semantic rule for a given sentence. It is at this point that naive operationalists are misled, for when they assert that a given concept means the particular operations performed, or particular types of behavior observed, they confuse semantics with pragmatics. The operations that were designed to specify the semantic meaning of the concept actually specify the pragmatic meaning, because of the failure to distinguish between operations that are performed and operations that should be performed. An example of concepts in which semiotic operations are embedded are Tolman's 'means-end-readiness' and Krechevsky's 'hypothesis.' Thus, means-end-readiness consists of a selectivity of potentially symbolic events and a syntactical ordering of these events, whereas the appearance of the hypothesis introduces the pragmatic relationship. When verified (by getting the food), the hypothesis becomes a semantic rule. Other examples are taken from testing, education, etc. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2006 APA, all rights reserved). © 1942 American Psychological Association.","GENERAL (INCL.

Buxton's criticism (see 17: 1102) of the attempt to find differential trends for the summary and verbatim items, based on the difference in difficulty of these two types of item, is invalidated by further work in which initial difficulty was equated without removing the differential trends. Buxton has rendered a service in sharpening the concept of 'opportunity to occur' in both reminiscence and forgetting, but the follows tradition in giving a formal or statistical meaning to it, rather than a psychological one.

The test-retest method has been invalidated on the ground of practice effect. Some review has also been detected. But more crucial criticisms are directed against the possibility of transfer to the test material from school curricula, and the fact that the greater S revival occurred mainly where the relative difficulty of V and S material was not controlled, and where absolute, rather than relative numbers of right and wrong responses were used. It is also argued that reminiscence was not proved to occur more in S than in V items.

Cantril is himself forced to appeal to an additional 'desire for meaning' motive. (3) Cantril's revision of G. W.

The various factors entering into aesthetic appreciation, i.e. the T, K, and specific factors, experimentally isolated, are reviewed.

W. Allport's theory that certain acts can provide their own motivation after the original incentive has disappeared, as against the traditional theory that secondary drives are learned elaborations of primary ones. There are 3 parts to a behavioral sequence: instigation, instrumental acts, and goal response. The problem is, can instrumental acts persist when the instigations which started them no longer exist? Yes, under three conditions: (1) removal of the instigation, (2) replacement by a more successful instrumental act, or (3) removal of the goal response or reward resulting. But it is difficult to prove that each of these conditions actually exists, due to inadequate criteria of their presence, or of the presence of conditioned substitutes. Removal of reward is technically 'extinction,' and this may be delayed by many factors. Hence, until all such possibilities are removed, Allport's main argument for functional autonomy loses force. It must be considered a gratuitous concept until an experimental instance can be found where an act continues even with all delaying factors ruled out.

Translatability between sentences in different languages is possible when they refer to the same event or to causally concomitant events.

Introspective psychologies were analytical sciences of mental content. Behaviorisms, with their emphasis on the levels of tropism, reflex, instinct, and learned acts, lacked a medium for establishing the genetic continuity suggested by these categories. Gestalt psychologies have searched for genotypical laws, and recognize that percepts and concepts are members of a total life-space, but their search for dynamically structured fields leads to static laws of structuring.

The movement to reform psychological methodology by emphasizing postulational techniques and operational definitions promises to achieve certain values. But to each a danger is linked. If it brings greater clarity in terminology, it also threatens to bring a pseudo-clarity by use of non-linguistic symbols, and a sacrifice of comprehensibility. The supposed value of increasing agreement between psychologists has failed to remove disagreements among those adopting the symbolic techniques. By increasing deductive rigor and strengthening theory as against data accumulation, we may discourage needed criticism and subordinate the phenomena to the logical system. The value gained through symbolic logic in excising metaphysical entities may bring 'theoretical asceticism' and a resulting sterility of concepts. The hope for augmented explanatory fruitfulness overlooks the recognized fact that derivation is tautological, involving mere renaming, or else tacitly implying explanatory entities. Finally, the value gained through ""elimination of the role of qualitative intuition, as promised by correlationism and operationism, is accompanied by the danger of obliteration of intensional differences.""

Reasons are here presented for keeping the two kinds of learning distinct. It is the first stage of the conditioning procedure that involves the unique feature of conditioning or associative, as contrasted with selective, learning, i.e. the development, through contiguity, by a neutral stimulus, of power to excite a response it previously did not control. In a later stage, unconditioned stimuli such as food and shock can function as do reward and punishment in trial-and-error learning, so that the distinction between selective and associative learning may break down. Therefore the term 'conditioning' should be restricted to the first stage of the procedure. Performing tests which are really problem-box experiments and calling the process conditioning merely confuses the issue. The commonly accepted view of conditioning as depending on a new sensori-motor connection is rejected in favor of one assuming a new dynamic relation between the sensory cortical patterns of the conditioned and unconditioned stimuli.

But pleasant experiences may conflict with the individual's frame of reference, i.e. his attitudes, and several studies indicate that this interferes with retention.

A look at Bridgman's motives for adopting an operational view in physics shows that he did it to prevent any future 'shocks' such as that which confronted classical physics with the advent of Einstein's relativity. By ignoring nature's attributes and concentrating on the operations of measurement, one avoids ontological questions. Certain invalid objections to operationism are listed, such as that operations are only adequate or inadequate, not true or false like concepts, or that concepts contain much more than operations can yield, or that immediate experience lies beyond the sphere of operations, or that every change in operations would require a new set of concepts. A crucial objection to operationism as here described is offered: namely, that there is a realm of physical objects and mental processes which impose a necessity on our choice of operations and hence this necessity will reappear in the realm of the operations themselves. The kinship of operationism and logical positivism is pointed out. A sound operationism accepts the triadic view, and limits itself to the interdependence between operations and concepts.

These must be accounted for by some selective process, which is usually assigned to the end organ rather than to the afferent nerve terminal. A study of the nature of stimulation, however, shows that afferent nerves and their impulses are qualitatively alike, and a quantitative description of the differences in volleys of nerve discharge constitutes a complete description of neural differences. What, then, is the basis of differentiation between sensations? An examination of hunger and nausea, cold and warmth, pain and pressure, indicates that they are differentiated in terms of the patterns of movement in given tissues which arouse corresponding patterns of nerve discharge. The word quality refers only to such a moment-by-moment representation of events at the periphery. The spatial and temporal pattern of the sensation is determined by the pattern of the volley of nerve impulses, but the modality is determined by the central region which furnishes the intrinsic nervous activity upon which the peripheral pattern is impressed.

The larval brood, through its activity, furnishes a social stimulation which increases the level of general colony excitement, and enlarges the social space.

The broadest interpretation makes it the total adjustment of the organism rather than a specific reaction.

It differs from mental set in being an active purposive process. A criticism of common methods of measuring attention is offered, in the light of the definition.

The relative contribution of retention and transfer to relearning efficiency is influenced by many factors, as passage of time, etc. Subjects who are experienced in learning a given kind of material may show smaller savings scores, by this method, than naive subjects, yet be better retainers or equally good.

Systems attempting to combine facts derived from both viewpoints, as, for example, theories of learning, must either introduce conflicting laws and concepts, as Thorndike's 'effect-belonging,' or else postulate new loci of action not open to observation as Koffka's 'geographic environment' and Freud's 'unconscious.' The objective approach is inadequate to predict anything but normative behavior because it must ignore those important but inaccessible causative factors involved in such individual variations of behavior as applied psychologists must deal with. The phenomenological approach, on the contrary, based on the assumption that behavior is determined by and pertinent to the phenomenological field of the behaving organism, is useful in individual prediction. The basic postulates of such a system and its use in prediction are outlined, with special reference to learning. Its advantages are that (1) it is anthropomorphic, (2) it can predict individual behavior and normative behavior as well, and (3) it postulates no explanatory, only a descriptive process. Gestalt psychology, purged of non-phenomenological data, is such a system. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2006 APA, all rights reserved). © 1941 American Psychological Association.","GENERAL (INCL.

This is usually interpreted as confirming the beta hypothesis, that repetition of a stimulus-response sequence never affects learning. But this is erroneous, for (1) the meaning of 'repetition' in these hypotheses is ambiguous, (2) beta does not follow from a disproof of alpha and gamma, and (3) negative practice experiments do not provide a situation where all factors except repetition are held constant. Among the possible explanations of the negative practice effect, the advantages and disadvantages of the following principles are indicated: (1) repetition of an S-R sequence strengthens it regardless of the consequences of the response, (2) repetition weakens the response, (3) it reinforces the response when followed by reward and weakens it when followed by punishment, and (4) the expectation that a certain response is right or wrong is strengthened by repetition.

Recent attempts in this direction have been made, as in the definition of the primary abilities, and the construction of tests designed to measure them, by Thurstone. The definition proposed by the author, however, is based not on factors, or special abilities, but on qualities. It sets forth the principal attributes of a functional concept of intellect.

Discrimination learning ordinarily centers on the acquisition of a single habit to the exclusion of others, while delayed response requires the concurrent acquisition and performance of 2 or more alternative habits and can therefore be regarded as a discrimination problem involving the irregular 'reversal' of the antagonistic habits concerned. Ordinary discrimination learning is the limiting case of delayed response in which every preceding trial is a training trial, consistently reinforcing a single association. Experimental evidence is quoted to clarify the important relation of pre-delay reinforcement and post-delay retention. When food is received upon the pre-delay trials, then retention, as measured by performance on post-delay trials, is inferior to that obtained by a procedure of no-food-before-delay. This contradicts the hypothesis that better retention follows greater reinforcement strength.

But the cross-sectional concepts like attention, perception, and emotion, should also be replaced by categories which recognize the adjustive, goal-directed character of behavior, and which indicate the variations affecting the adequacy of the response unit. 3 such categories are suggested which account for all variations in response having adjustmental significance, namely, maintenance of direction in behavior, response to relationships, and energy level.

The effect should vary at different stages in learning, depending on the relative importance of the two sets of factors.

This assumption is not substantiated by evidence as to development of vocabulary as a function of age. An explanation of why the test can yield valid results in spite of this false assumption is to be found in the fact that most words can be defined in a variety of ways, varying widely in difficulty. A shift from more to less difficult definitions would not show up as a lower score on her test. This hypothesis must be verified by two lines of research: (1) a qualitative analysis of the definitions of words used by deteriorated and non-deteriorated subjects; and (2) the comparison of methods used in the solution of problems where the goal result can be reached by a number of different methods of varying difficulty.

On the first and third problems the historic concepts of instinct and faculty have exerted a strong influence; but opinion has been divided as to what abilities, if any, are immutable. Answers to the second question have largely hinged on the number of faculties or traits recognized; the fewer the number, the more general their character has been considered, as with the Spearman versus the Thorndike theories of intelligence.

His system is defective in its mathematical uncertainties, in the assumption of successive interactions on which it is based, and on its failure to account for numerous components. Krueger's system has the same defects.

F.

The behavioristic bias, that the former is more easily observed, is false. Measurements are no more exact, and important links in the causal series are left out. There is no rational point of division between external and internal behavior. A correlation between them is essential to completed research, and this need not wait upon ""a rigorous description at the level of behavior."" The modern sophisticated psychologist is not justified in an elaborate emphasis on the overt aspects of thinking, emotion, attention, and sensing. An example is symbolic behavior at the level of the delayed response, which goes beyond simple conditioning and requires the assumption of a correlation between the overt choice and some entity of the neurophysiological substrate. Limitations of knowledge about the nervous system, due to the recency of adequate techniques, do not justify abandoning the internal approach; many aspects of behavior can never be understood through any other approach.

Although operational definition of empirical constructs is essential, it is in the subsequent processes of inductive generalization and in hypothetico-deductive theorizing that the essential explanatory work occurs, and, even at the level of empirical laws, no help can be derived from operationism. On the formal side, the authors discuss the distinction between Hull's use of the 'postulational' and 'hypothetico-deductive' methods and their usual meaning as employed by theoretical scientists. Hull actually begins with operationally defined terms or experimental variables rather than with formal terms or guesses as to the choice of variables and mathematical relationships between them; it is in the deductive elaboration of the consequences that his method resembles theirs.

Such a science would be distinguished from personal psychology (1) in its problems; (2) in its method, the comparative-historical method; (3) in its fundamental assumption, i.e., of the possibility of prediction for the group, rather than for the individual. Group prediction is more accurate. The laws of group behavior should be simpler than those of individual behavior. Every source of information, such as social anthropology, history, archeology, ethnology, philology, would be drawn upon in this comparative method. Its claim to a science would rest on its postulation of the operation of natural law, since it could not be an experimental science.

For example, the supposed dynamic interaction of hunger tension and food-goal valence, which causes a rat to run a maze, can be interpreted as the result of a motor tension system established in some previous maze-running situation; for if food is removed the rat still runs. Another example is the continuation of interrupted work, which is explained, not by psychic tension, but by a persistent motor set.

The present-day clinical concept assumes the primary criterion to be social inadequacy, caused by an innate lack of mental capacity, based on incomplete mental development, due to constitutional causes, and affecting the organism as a whole in structure and function. The condition is both diagnostic and prognostic in the pre-adult period of life. Feeble-minded are classified by grade as idiot, imbecile, and moron; by form as endogenous and exogenous; and by type as familial, mongoloid, cretin, etc., showing that feeble-mindedness is an aggregate of various clinical syndromes. The clinical appraisal of mental deficiency requires evaluation in terms of a number of criteria, such as social inadequacy, mental inadequacy, of which intelligence is only one phase, developmental retardation, educational inaptitude as distinguished from special educational deficiencies, and somatic infantility. Theories of mental deficiency include that of a simple quantitative deviation from the norm, that of pathological abnormality, and that of reversion to an atavistic state. Psychologists should give much more careful attention to the determination of mental deficiency than is reflected in most psychological research work to date.

These are (1) preparation for research and higher learning, (2) preparation for privileged leisure, and (3) a terminal education for a wide upper intellectual stratum. Selection, in the interests of both college and student, requires more information than can be obtained from school records, group tests, or personal interviews. A pre-college institute should be conducted for prospective students for detailed study of their aptitudes and interests. A research project now set up at Harvard, the Grant Study in Social Adjustments, is studying several students who have made superior social adjustments. Their personality organization is analyzed from a morphological, physiological, and psychological direction. For example, introverts are found to make good scholastic adjustments if they have mathematical aptitude, while extroversion fits best with verbal aptitude. Paper and pencil tests fail to uncover the creative or autogenous mind. Hence students having either extremely good personality organization, or whose autogenous responses are superior to their selective responses, do better in college than paper tests would predict.

Thus, terms like 'body' and 'mind' have gone back and forth from one to another of these categories. Parallelists try to disprove causal relations between 4 and 5, or 4 and 6; and some between 3 and 6 or 5 and 6. Interactionists support interaction between 4 and 5 and inadvertently between 3 and 4; yet the admission of one type is no logical argument for admission of the others. The terms sensation, consciousness, and cause are also used in different meanings. Sensation may mean sensing, or sense data, or nerve process. Consciousness may mean awareness or content of it. Introspection may mean awareness of awareness, or of all or of certain content. Cause has many meanings; thus 'transfer of energy' applies only to 5, but invariable antecedence-consequence is most fundamental and should suffice for psychology.

The latter theory holds that the animal selects and responds to each of a repertoire of hypotheses till the correct one is hit upon, rather than reacting to each relevant cue aspect; thus if the values of the cue stimuli were reversed, positive for negative, later learning should not be retarded. Considerable experimental data bearing on the problem is examined, and it is concluded that the data lend further support to the continuity theory. It is admitted that experimental evidence exists for pre-solution responses or ""hypotheses,"" but these are interpreted by Spence not as evidences of insight or intelligence, but as blind trial-error adjustments showing a low degree of intelligence, because they persist even though ineffectual.

Positive transfer occurs where the second task permits discrimination acquired in the first task to function; negative transfer where discrimination between some aspect of the two tasks themselves is required in addition to learning the second.

Hence a self can not only cooperate effectively with the objective world but also with other selves.

Conditioning, which is the behavioristic equivalent of the principle of association by contiguity, on the contrary attempts to predict the movements themselves, not only the end results. It is the difficulty of extending explanations by association (conditioning) from mere S-R relationships to significant action that has caused current dissatisfaction with the principle. Many experimenters (Hilgard, Skinner, Razran, etc.) have suggested that there are two varieties of conditioning. Hilgard assumes ""reward"" and ""reinforcement,"" Skinner distinguishes between ""S"" type and ""R"" type, Razran speaks of ""qualitative"" as a distinct type from ""quantitative"" conditioning. In each case it is clear that the former type deals with acts or results, the latter with particular movements.

Sources of modification of judgments are discussed, in five groups, and their applicability considered. Certain generalizations regarding the observed inhibition of responses to the second stimulus of a pair in spinal reflexes, the lid reflex, and judgments of paired tones, are offered as part of a theory of positive time-order error.

Thus it might include a single cell or the universe. A society might be an organism in which persons are nodal points only. One might use a unit of measurement indicating degrees of organization.

As defined by Palmer, this requires only two observations, separated in time, regardless of the length of the intervening interval. But growth and development imply change, and hence a longitudinal study must comprise a series of observations on a changing phenomenon taken successively from the moment of inception until the changing characteristics attains stability or decline.

This method of multiple-variable design is especially applicable where complex interaction of variables exists. It yields greater economy, a broader inductive basis for generalization of results, and greater comprehensiveness.

These facts show the necessity of a definition of learning which takes account of alterations of the nervous system itself.

Hoppe found that the subject experiences success or failure in terms of this intermediate goal. He determined this ""level of aspiration"" by a crude inferential technique. Later investigators rejected his method and substituted an objective measure, by asking the subject to choose from a set of graded problems the one which he wished to attempt. This introduced a discrepancy between the subject's inner desire and his overtly expressed desire, the latter being distorted by the social factor. Hence the author suggests that the so-called ""inner level of aspiration"" is a myth, that it is too vague to be called a ""level"" and should rather be thought of as a zone which shifts with conditions. Then the term ""level of aspiration"" could be reserved for the artificial but objective and quantifiable indication which the subject makes overtly regarding his future performance in a given activity. As such the concept represents one of the most interesting personality variables uncovered in recent years.

The first of these is termed ""variability""; it includes Krechevsky's hypothesis behavior and accounts for trial-and-error learning. The second, called ""equivalence reactions,"" involves the process commonly called ""transfer of training,"" and makes possible what has been called ""concept formation,"" where some limited aspect of a situation comes to evoke the response. The third is named ""spontaneous integration,"" or reasoning, and is shown to differ basically from learning in its neurological and psychological basis. This third type of problem solving is probably dependent on the integrating effect of certain forces outside the integrated experiences themselves. These are called ""directions,"" and they may be of two sorts, either habitual, like hypotheses, determining tendencies, etc., or ""new"" and unaffected by past associations. The latter kind can survive brain operations and can reintegrate memory traces, whereas the former kind cannot.

It appears as characteristic of the constancy mechanism that high correlations of the response with distal factors may be accompanied by low correlations with the mediating proximal cues. The author's ultimate aim is to establish a multi-dimensional psychophysics which will include the distal environment within its scope.

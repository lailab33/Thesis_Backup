In total, 48 meta-analyses were conducted, including 26 variables classified as antecedents, 8 as consequences, and 14 as correlates. Statistical artifacts were found to account for the variance between studies in only one meta-analysis that used attendance. Type organizational commitment (attitudinal vs. calculative) was proposed as a moderator variable and was found to account for significant between-study variance in 9 of 18 comparisons. Theoretical and methodological issues pertaining to the measurement of various forms of organizational commitment, its interrelations with other forms of attachments, and its role in causal models of behavior in organizations are reviewed. Directions for future research are highlighted.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Aldag, R.J., Brief, A.P., Supervisor style and police role stress (1978) Journal of Police Science and Administration, 6, pp. 362-367; Angle, H.L., Perry, J.L., Dual commitment and labor-management relationship climates (1986) Academy of Management Journal, 29, pp. 31-50; Arariya, N., Ferris, K.R., Organizational-professional conflict among US. and Israeli professional accountants (1983) Journal of Social Psychology, 119, pp. 153-161; Aranya, N., Jacobson, D., An empirical study of theories of organizational and occupational commitment (1975) Journal of Social Psychology, 97, pp. 15-22; Arnold, H.J., Feldman, D.C., A multivariate analysis of the determinants of job turnover (1982) Journal of Applied Psychology, 67, pp. 350-360; Arnold, H.J., Feldman, D.C., Purbhoo, M., The role of social desirability response bias in turnover research (1985) Academy of Management Journal, 28, pp. 955-966; Baron, R.M., Kenny, D.A., The moderator-mediator distinction in social psychological research: Conceptual, strategic, and statistical considerations (1986) Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 51, pp. 1173-1182; Bateman, T.S., Strasser, S., A longitudinal analysis of the antecedents of organizational commitment (1984) Academy of Management Journal, 27, pp. 95-112; Becker, H.S., Notes on the concept of commitment (1960) American Journal of Sociology, 66, pp. 32-42; Berger, C.J., Cummings, L.L., Organizational structure, attitudes and behaviors (1979) Research in Organizational Behavior, 1, pp. 169-208; Blau, G.J., The measurement and prediction of career commitment (1985) Journal of Occupational Psychology, 58, pp. 277-288; Blau, G.J., Job involvement and organizational commitment as interactive predictors of tardiness and absenteeism (1986) Journal of Management, 12, pp. 577-584; Blau, G.J., Using a person-environment fit model to predict job involvement and organizational commitment (1987) Journal of Vocational Behavior, 30, pp. 240-257; Bluedorn, A.C., A unified model of turnover from organizations (1982) Human Relations, 35, pp. 135-153; Boudreau, J.W., Berger, C.J., Decision-theoretic utility analysis applied to employee separations and acquisitions (1985) Journal of Applied Psychology, 70, pp. 581-612; Bruning, N.S., Snyder, R.A., Sex and position as predictors of organizational commitment (1983) Academy of Management Journal, 26, pp. 485-491; Campbell, D.T., Fiske, D.W., Convergent and discriminant validation by the multitrait-multimethod matrix (1959) Psychological Bulletin, 56, pp. 81-105; Chassie, M., Bhagat, R.S., Role stress in working woman: Differential effect on selected organizational outcomes (1980) Group and Organization Studies, 5, pp. 224-233; Clegg, C.W., Psychology of employee lateness, absence, and turnover: A methodological critique and an empirical study (1983) Journal of Applied Psychology, 68, pp. 88-101; Cohen, J., (1969) Statistical Power Analysis for the Behavioral Sciences, , New York: Academic Press; Cook, J., Wall, T., New work attitude measures of trust, organizational commitment and personal need non-fulfillment (1980) Journal of Occupational Psychology, 53, pp. 39-52; Cook, T.D., Campbell, D.T., (1979) Quasi-experimentation: Design & Analysis Issues for Field Settings, , Boston: Houghton Mifflin; DeCotiis, T.A., Summers, T.P., A path-analysis of a model of the antecedents and consequences of organizational commitment (1987) Human Relations, 40, pp. 445-470; Dougherty, T.W., Bluedorn, A.C., Keon, T.L., Precursors of employee turnover: A multi-sample causal analysis (1985) Journal of Occupational Behaviour, 6, pp. 259-271; Ferris, K.R., Organizational commitment and performance in a professional accounting firm (1981) Accounting, Organization, and Society, 6, pp. 317-326; Ferris, K.R., Aranya, N., A comparison of two organizational commitment scales (1983) Personnel Psychology, 36, pp. 87-98; Fishbein, M., Ajzen, I., (1975) Belief Attitude, Intention and Behaviour.

This article reviews empirical research relevant to hindsight phenomena. The influence of outcome knowledge, termed creeping determinism, was initially hypothesized to result from the immediate and automatic integration of the outcome into a person's knowledge of an event. Later research has identified at least 4 plausible, general strategies for responding to hindsight questions. These explanations postulate that outcome information affects the selection of evidence to make a judgment, the evidence evaluation, the manner in which evidence is integrated, or the response generation process. It is also likely, in some situations, that a combination of 2 or more of these mechanisms produce the observed hindsight effects. We provide an interpretation of the creeping determinism hypothesis in terms of inferences made to reevaluate case-specific evidence once the relevant outcome is known and conclude that it is the most common mechanism underlying observed hindsight effects.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Hawkins, S.A.; Graduate School of Business, , Chicago, IL 60637, United States",,,,,,,,00332909,,PSBUA,,"English","Psychol.

Investigators have typically focused on objective, economic measures of performance. However, social-psychological measures are important because negotiators often do not have the information necessary to make accurate judgments of the bargaining situation. Negotiators' judgments are biased, and biases are associated with inefficient performance. Personality and individual differences appear to play a minimal role in determining bargaining behavior; their impact may be dampened by several factors, such as homogeneity of subject samples, situational constraints, and self-selection processes. Motivational and cognitive models provide compelling accounts of negotiation behavior. A psychological theory of negotiation should begin at the level of the individual negotiator and should integrate features of motivational and cognitive models.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Thompson, L.; Department of Psychology, , Seattle, WA 98195, United States; email: Ithompson@max.acs.washington.edu",,,,,,,,00332909,,PSBUA,,"English","Psychol.

The Monte Carlo study was used to investigate how well the methods recovered the subgroup structure that had been built into the actors' and partners' modes. Forty-eight sociomatrices were generated using a 24 × 3 factorial design. The factors included the number of individuals in the network, the true number of subgroups into which the individuals were classified, the proportion of individuals falling into each of the subgroups, the structure of the dyadic interactions, and the clarity of the subgroup structure. On the basis of the simulation study's results, subgroups were derived for two real data sets. The first data set described the relations in a monastery (Sampson, 1968). The second data set described the referral network of a service provider (Reingen &amp; Kernan, 1986).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Allison, P.D., Liker, J.K., Analyzing sequential categorical data on dyadic interaction: A comment on Gottman (1982) Psychological Bulletin, 91, pp. 393-403; Breiger, R.L., Boorman, S.A., Arabie, P., An algorithm for clustering relational data with applications to social network analysis and comparison with multidimensional scaling (1975) Journal of Mathematical Psychology, 12, pp. 328-383; Budescu, D.V., Tests of lagged dominance in sequential dyadic interaction (1984) Psychological Bulletin, 96, pp. 402-414; Chang, W., On using principal components before separating a mixture of two multivariate normal distributions (1983) Applied Statistics, 32, pp. 267-275; Clark, J.A., McQuitty, L.L., Some problems and elaborations of iterative, intercolumnar correlational analysis (1970) Educational and Psychological Measurement, 30, pp. 773-784; Dillon, W.R., Madden, T.J., Kumar, A., Analyzing sequential categorical data on dyadic interaction: A latent structure approach (1983) Psychological Bulletin, 94, pp. 564-583; Dumas, J.E., Interactional correlates of treatment outcome in behavioral parent training (1984) Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology, 52, pp. 946-954; Dumas, J.E., Controlling for autocorrelation in social interaction analysis (1986) Psychological Bulletin, 100, pp. 125-127; Faraone, S.V., Dorfman, D.D., Lag sequential analysis: Robust statistical methods (1987) Psychological Bulletin, 101, pp. 312-323; Faust, K., (1985) A Comparative Evaluation of Methods for Positional Analysis of Social Networks, , Unpublished doctoral dissertation, University of California, Irvine; Feick, L.F., Novak, J.A., Analyzing sequential categorical data on dyadic interaction: Log-linear models exploiting the order in variables (1985) Psychological Bulletin, 98, pp. 600-611; Fienberg, S.E., Meyer, M.M., Wasserman, S.S., Statistical analysis of multiple sociometric relations (1985) Journal of the American Statistical Association, 80, pp. 51-67; Fienberg, S.E., Wasserman, S.S., Categorical data analysis of single sociometric relations (1981) Sociological Methodology, pp. 156-192. , S.

Explanations are selected by questions and are thus governed by general rules of discourse. A conversational model of causal explanation is introduced that explicates social aspects of the explanation process by postulating that good explanations must be relevant to the focus of a why question, as well as being true. The notion of explanatory relevance enables an integration of the major models of the attribution process by showing that they use the same counterfactual logic but address different causal questions. The conversational perspective suggests a reinterpretation of many attributional biases, and also highlights the role of interpersonal goals in generating implicit questions, which in turn constrain explanations.

Most studies have focused on Type I error rates and the power of the chi-square statistic, but some have been more concerned with the theoretical justification behind methods of analysis. Little consensus has been achieved in either area. The reason for this is that 2 basic inferential paradigms that underlie much of the work in 2 × 2 tables are incompatible. Thus, empirical studies of Type I error rates of the chi-square test within the Neyman-Pearson framework are considered irrelevant by advocates of Fisher's exact test. Both approaches are described in this article. Barnard's 1947 test is shown to be theoretically superior to the chi-square test and all of its corrected cousins.

Distinctions are drawn between the concepts of hard determinism, soft determinism, libertarianism, conscious choice, beliefs about conscious control, volitional behavior, and actual personal control. Relevant theories reviewed include Zavalloni's feedback theory, Rychlak's telosponse theory, Tageson's three-dimensional model, Sperry's theory of supervenient control, Bandura's theory of agency, and the chaos concept. Data relevant to these theories are reviewed. It is concluded that theories of free will can be compatible with the scientific tasks of prediction and control. However, the free will vs. determinism issue is unlikely to be resolved conclusively by using scientific data.

Box 39040, Ramat Aviv, 69978 Tel Aviv, Israel","Latent inhibition (LI) refers to decrement in conditioning to a stimulus as a result of its prior nonreinforced preexposure. It is a robust phenomenon that has been demonstrated in a variety of classical and instrumental conditioning procedures and in many mammalian species, including humans. The development of LI is considered to reflect decreased associability of, or attention to, stimuli that predict no significant outcome. The fact that LI is considered to be a reflection of attentional processes has become of increasing importance to neuroscientists who see LI as a convenient tool for measuring the effects of drug treatments and lesions on attention. The present article surveys the data on brain systems, which have been studied in regard to their involvement in LI. These are reviewed and discussed separately in sections on noradrenergic, cholinergic, dopaminergic, serotonergic, and septo-hippocampal manipulations. On the basis of these data, it is concluded that the neural substrates of LI include the mesolimbic dopaminergic system, the mesolimbic serotonergic system, and the hippocampus. It is proposed that the preexposed stimulus loses its capacity to affect behavior in conditioning, even though it predicts reinforcement, because the hippocampus inhibits the switching mechanism of the nucleus accumbens via the subiculum-accumbens pathway. This action of the hippocampus is modulated by the mesolimbic serotonergic system via its interactions with the hippocampal or mesolimbic dopaminergic systems, or both.",,"neurotransmitter; animal; brain; conditioned reflex; human; learning; nerve cell inhibition; physiology; reaction time; review; Animal; Association Learning; Brain; Conditioning, Classical; Human; Neural Inhibition; Neurotransmitters; Reaction Time",,"Neurotransmitters",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Ackil, J., Mellgren, R.L., Halgren, C., Frommer, S.P., Effects of CS preexposure on avoidance learning in rats with hippocampal lesions (1969) Journal of Comparative and Physiological Psychology, 69, pp. 739-747; Alheid, G.F., Heimer, L., New perspectives in basal forebrain organization of special relevance for neuropsychiatric disorders the striatopallidal, amygdaloid and corticopetal components of substantia innominata (1988) Neuroscience, 27, pp. 1-41; Amaral, P.G., Sinnamon, H.M., The locus coeruleus: Neurobiology of a central noradrenergic nucleus (1977) Progress in Neurobiology, 1, pp. 147-196; Anscombe, F., The disorder of consciousness in schizophrenia (1987) Schizophrenia Bulletin, 2, pp. 241-260; Archer, T., The role of noradrenaline in learned behaviors (1982) Scandinavian Journal of Psychology Supplement, 1, pp. 61-71; Archer, T., Jarbe, T.V.C., Mohammed, A.K., Priedite, G., The effect of stimulus preexposure upon the context effect in taste-aversion learning in noradrenaline-depleted rats (1985) Scandinavian Journal of Psychology, 26, pp. 158-169; Archer, T., Mohammed, A.K., Jarbe, T.U., Latent inhibition following systemic DSP: Effects due to presence and absence of contextual cues in taste aversion learning (1983) Behavioral and Neural Biology, 38, pp. 287-306; Asarnow, R.F., Marder, S.R., Mintz, J., Van Putten, T., Zimmerman, K.E., Differential effect of low and conventional doses of fluphenazine on schizophrenic outpatients with good or poor information-processing abilities (1988) Archives of General Psychiatry, 45, pp. 822-826; Bannon, M.S., Roth, R.H., Pharmacology of mesocortical dopamine neurons (1983) Pharmacological Reviews, 35, pp. 53-68; Barrett, R.J., Leith, N.J., Ray, O.S., Permanent facilitation of avoidance behavior by d-amphetamine and scopolamine (1972) Psychopharmacology, 25, pp. 321-331; Baruch, I., Hemsley, D., Gray, J.A., Differential performance of acute and chronic schizophrenics in a latent inhibition task (1988) Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease, 176, pp. 598-606; Bleuler, E., (1966) Dementia Praecox or the Group of Schizophrenias, , J.

This Newtonian differentiator model proposes that sons of alcoholics exhibit acute sensitization as blood alcohol level rises and acute tolerance as blood alcohol level falls, compared with sons of nonalcoholics.

However, direct application of Fourier theory to reaction time data has sometimes produced disappointing results. This article reviews Fourier transform theory as it applies to the problem of deconvolving a component of the reaction time distribution. Problems encountered in deconvolution are shown to be due to the presence of noise in the Fourier transforms of the sampled distributions, which is amplified by the operation of deconvolution. A variety of filtering techniques for the removal of noise are discussed, including window functions, adaptive kernel smoothing, and optimal Wiener filtering. The best results were obtained using a window function whose pass band was determined empirically from the power spectrum of the deconvolved distribution. These findings are discussed in relation to other, nontrigonometric approaches to the problem of deconvolution.",,"article; computer program; computer simulation; Fourier analysis; human; reaction time; statistical model; Computer Simulation; Fourier Analysis; Human; Models, Statistical; Reaction Time; Software; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Smith, P.L.; University of Adelaide, Adelaide, SA, Australia",,,,,,,,00332909,,PSBUA,"2270239","English","Psychol.

Despite the reported success of this intervention, high levels of resistance, poor engagement, and inadequate maintenance of improvements are observed for a substantial proportion of distressed families. These obstacles have inspired enhancement efforts to improve basic social learning family-intervention models. The present review identifies promising approaches for maximizing treatment gains for the conduct-disordered child. Relevant studies were organized into 3 approaches: enhancements and expansions (a) within a dyadic (parent-child) interaction model, (b) within a broad-based model that acknowledges a wider range of family influences, and (c) through a multisystems model. SLFI enhancements within the dyadic model have centered on either the strengthening of parental skills already included in the SLFI regimen or the adding of new interactional strategies. Some gains, but only partial success, have been achieved with the dyadic model supplements. SLFI expansions from a broad-based model have focused on parental adjustment, parental expectations during treatment, and social-environmental stressors. The multisystems adjuncts to SLFI include cognitive-behavioral interventions to affect peer relations and ecological approaches to sweep across domains. The broad-based and multisystems expansions have produced promising but undertested treatment regimens. Related areas of investigation included therapy process research, medication combined with SLFI, and the involvement of fathers in treatment. Recommendations are offered for improvement of SLFI research. The apparent theoretical crossroads for SLFI treatment of childhood conduct disorder are discussed.",,"behavior disorder; child; child parent relation; family therapy; human; methodology; psychopathy; review; socialization; Antisocial Personality Disorder; Child; Child Behavior Disorders; Family Therapy; Human; Parent-Child Relations; Socialization; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",,,,,"National Institute of Mental Health, NIMH: R01MH038667",,,,,,,,,,,"Achenbach, T.M., The child behavior profile I.

Although several parameters of this association have been identified, the process by which exposure to interparental conflict gives rise to adjustment problems in children is largely unexplored. Research on the link between marital conflict and child maladjustment therefore is critically evaluated, and a framework is presented that organizes existing studies and suggests directions for future research on processes that may account for the association. According to the framework, the impact of marital conflict is mediated by children's understanding of the conflict, which is shaped by contextual, cognitive, and developmental factors.

Third, the LGS is suited to nonlinear as well as linear monotonic growth. Fourth, a consistency index associated with the LGS methodology, CL, indicates the extent to which cumulative, unitary development characterizes a particular latent variable. Finally, and perhaps most important, because a model of the growth undergone by the latent variable being measured is incorporated in the LGS model the resulting instruments enjoy a high level of construct validity.

First, issues arising from the recurrent, episodic, heterogeneous nature of depression are discussed. Second, studies on the adjustment of children with a depressed parent are summarized. Early studies that used depressed parents as controls for schizophrenic parents found equivalent risk for child disturbance. Subsequent studies using better-defined samples of depressed parents found that these children were at risk for a full range of adjustment problems and at specific risk for clinical depression. Third, the parenting difficulties of depressed parents are described and explanatory models of child adjustment problems are outlined. Contextual factors, particularly marital distress, remain viable alternative explanations for both child and parenting problems.

Thus, many studies of neurologically normal alcoholics may have been confounded by the inclusion of patients with neurologically asymptomatic Wernicke-Korsakoff neuropathology. Postmortem and in vivo studies have shown that alcoholics, irrespective of neurological diagnosis, have widespread pathology involving many cortical and subcortical sites. In addition, clinical studies have indicated that, like neurologically asymptomatic alcoholics, alcoholic Korsakoff patients may enjoy substantial recovery in cognitive function. Furthermore, the common research strategy of identifying a subset of neurologically diagnosed Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome as a discrete group of ""pure"" Korsakoff's amnesia by using a definitional IQ-Wechsler Memory Scale quotient difference may have created a neuropsychological stereotype that is not representative of the broader clinical group.

It then describes the controversy that ensued and analyzes the complexity and contemporary relevance of the question itself. Going beyond clinical inference, it identifies select cognitive biases and constraints that cause decision errors, and proposes remedial correctives. Given that the evidence shows cognition to be flawed, the article discusses the linear regression, Bayesian, signal detection, and computer approaches as possible decision aids. Their cost-benefit trade-offs, when used either alone or as complements to one another, are examined and evaluated. The critique concludes with a note of cautious optimism regarding the formula's future role as a decision aid and offers several interim solutions.",,"cognition; decision making; human; problem solving; review; thinking; Cognition; Human; Judgment; Problem Solving; Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.; Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.; Thinking",,,,,"U.S. National Library of Medicine, NLM: R01LM004583",,,,,,,,,,,"Abelson, R.P., A variance explanation paradox: When a little is a lot (1985) Psychological Bulletin, 97, pp. 129-133; Adams, I.D., Chan, M., Clifford, P.C., Cooke, W.M., Dallos, V., De Dombal, F.T., Edwards, M.H., Wilson, D.H., Computer aided diagnosis of acute abdominal pain: A multicentre study (1986) British Medical Journal, 293, pp. 800-804; Alexander, L.B., Kleinmuntz, B., Computer program for the Meehl-Dahlstrom MMPI profile rules (1962) Educational and Psychological Measurement, 22, pp. 193-199; Anderson, J.R., Reder, L., Effects of number of facts studied on recognition versus sensibility judgments (1987) Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition, 13, pp. 355-367; Arkes, H.R., Impediments to accurate clinical judgment and possible ways to minimize their impact (1981) Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology, 49, pp. 323-330; Arkes, H.R., Dawes, R.M., Christensen, C., Factors influencing the use of a decision rule in a probabilistic task (1986) Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes, 37, pp. 93-110; Arkes, H.R., Hammond, K.R., (1986) Judgment and Decision Making: An Interdisciplinary Reader, , New York: Cambridge University Press; Ashton, A.H., Ashton, R.H., Aggregating subjective forecasts: Some empirical results (1985) Management Science, 31, pp. 1499-1508; Alhton, R.H., Combining the judgments of experts: How many and which ones?

A drawback of existing indexes is that they estimate no known population parameters. A new coefficient is proposed to summarize the relative reduction in the noncentrality parameters of two nested models. Two estimators of the coefficient yield new normed (CFI) and nonnormed (FI) fit indexes. CFI avoids the underestimation of fit often noted in small samples for Bentler and Bonett's (1980) normed fit index (NFI). FI is a linear function of Bentler and Bonett's non-normed fit index (NNFI) that avoids the extreme underestimation and overestimation often found in NNFI. Asymptotically, CFI, FI, NFI, and a new index developed by Bollen are equivalent measures of comparative fit, whereas NNFI measures relative fit by comparing noncentrality per degree of freedom. All of the indexes are generalized to permit use of Wald and Lagrange multiplier statistics. An example illustrates the behavior of these indexes under conditions of correct specification and misspecification. The new fit indexes perform very well at all sample sizes.",,"article; human; methodology; personality test; psychometry; reference value; statistical model; Human; Models, Statistical; Personality Tests; Psychometrics; Reference Values; Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",,,,,"National Institute on Drug Abuse, NIDA: P01DA001070",,,,,,,,,,,"Andersen, J.C., Gerbing, A.W., The effect of sampling error on convergence, improper solutions, and goodness-of-fit indices for maximum likelihood confirmatory factor analysis (1984) Psychometrika, 49, pp. 155-173; Bearden, W.O., Sharma, S., Teel, J.E., Sample size effects on chi square and other statistics used in evaluating causal models (1982) Journal of Marketing Research, 19, pp. 425-430; Bentler, P.M., Some contributions to efficient statistics for structural models: Specification and estimation of moment structures (1983) Psychometrika, 48, pp. 493-517; Bentler, P.M., (1986) Lagrange Multiplier and Wald Tests for EQS and EQS/PC, , Los Angeles: BMDP Statistical Software; Bentler, P.M., (1989) EQS Structural Equations Program Manual, , Los Angeles: BDMP Statistical Software; Bentler, P.M., Bonett, D.G., Significance tests and goodness of fit in the analysis of covariance structures (1980) Psychological Bulletin, 88, pp. 588-606; Bentler, P.M., Bonett, D.G., This week's Citation Classic (1987) Current Contents S&BS, 19 (37), p. 16; Bentler, P.M., Dijkstra, T., Efficient estimation via linearization in structural models (1985) Multivariate Analysis, 6, pp. 9-42. , P.

To make a refined assessment of the magnitude of gender differences in mathematics performance, we performed a meta-analysis of 100 studies. They yielded 254 independent effect sizes, representing the testing of 3,175,188 Ss. Averaged over all effect sizes based on samples of the general population, d was -0.05, indicating that females outperformed males by only a negligible amount. For computation, d was -0.14 (the negative value indicating superior performance by females). For understanding of mathematical concepts, d was -0.03; for complex problem solving, d was 0.08. An examination of age trends indicated that girls showed a slight superiority in computation in elementary school and middle school. There were no gender differences in problem solving in elementary or middle school; differences favoring men emerged in high school (d = 0.29) and in college (d = 0.32). Gender differences were smallest and actually favored females in samples of the general population, grew larger with increasingly selective samples, and were largest for highly selected samples and samples of highly precocious persons. The magnitude of the gender difference has declined over the years; for studies published in 1973 or earlier d was 0.31, whereas it was 0.14 for studies published in 1974 or later. We conclude that gender differences in mathematics performance are small. Nonetheless, the lower performance of women in problem solving that is evident in high school requires attention.",,"aptitude; article; clinical trial; female; gender identity; human; identity; male; mathematics; meta analysis; problem solving; Aptitude; Female; Gender Identity; Human; Identification (Psychology); Male; Mathematics; Meta-Analysis; Problem Solving; Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Hyde, J.S.; University of Wisconsin, Madison, United States",,,,,,,,00332909,,PSBUA,"2138794","English","Psychol.

This article reviews research examining increased self-focused attention in these disorders. Results indicate that regardless of the particular disorder under investigation, a heightened degree of self-focused attention is found. Hence, as ordinarily conceptualized, self-focused attention has little discriminatory power among different psychological disorders. Using information processing constructs, a somewhat different model of self-focused attention is proposed, and it is suggested that certain deviations in this process constitute a psychopathological kind of attention. A meta-construct model of descriptive psychopathology is then outlined to examine how certain aspects of attention can be considered specific to certain disorders and others common to different disorders.",,"attention; awareness; cognition; control; human; mental disease; psychological aspect; review; self concept; Attention; Awareness; Cognition; Human; Internal-External Control; Mental Disorders; Self Concept",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Abelson, R.P., The psychological status of the script concept (1981) American Psychologist, 36, pp. 5-729; (1987) Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (3rd Ed., Revised), , Washington, DC: Author; Anderson, J.R., A spreading activation theory of memory (1983) Journal of Verbal Learning and Verbal Behavior, 22, pp. 261-295; Beck, A.T., (1967) Depression: Clinical, Experimental, and Theoretical Aspects, , New York: Hoeber; Beck, A.T., (1976) Cognitive Therapy and the Emotional Disorders, , New York: International University Press; Beck, A.T., Brown, G., Steer, R.A., Eidelson, J.I., Riskind, J.H., Differentiating anxiety and depression: A test of the cognitive content specificity hypothesis (1987) Journal of Abnormal Psychology, 96, pp. 179-183; Becker, J., Vulnerable self-esteem as a predisposing factor in depression disorders (1979) The Psychobiology of Depressive Disorders: Implications for the Effects of Stress, pp. 317-334. , R.

Involvement of right hemispheric dysfunction in these disabilities has been hypothesized, as studies with adults have suggested that documented right hemisphere damage may lead to deficits in social skills, prosody, spatial orientation, problem solving, and recognition of nonverbal cues. Studies of children purported to evidence nonverbal learning disabilities are reviewed and compared with the results from studies of adults with right hemisphere damage. Specific subtypes of nonverbal learning disabilities are reviewed, including the nonverbal perceptual-organization-output subtype, Asperger's Syndrome, Developmental Gerstmann Syndrome, left hemisyndrome, right hemisphere syndrome, and right parietal lobe syndrome. Finally, implications and future research needs are addressed. The need for a diagnostic nosology and improved and validated intervention techniques is stressed as is early identification of these types of specific nonverbal learning disabilities.",,"adaptive behavior; adolescent; adult; child; child development; cognitive defect; hemispheric dominance; human; learning disorder; psychological aspect; review; social adaptation; Adaptation, Psychological; Adolescent; Adult; Child; Child Development; Delirium, Dementia, Amnestic, Cognitive Disorders; Dominance, Cerebral; Human; Learning Disorders; Social Adjustment",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Semrud-Clikeman, M.; Department of Educational Psychology, United States",,,,,,,,00332909,,PSBUA,"2181523","English","Psychol.

Although usually regarded as first-rank symptoms of schizophrenia, they are found in a wide range of medical and psychiatric conditions. Moreover, a substantial minority of otherwise normal individuals report hallucinatory experiences. The purpose of this article is to review the considerable research into the cognitive mechanisms underlying (particularly psychotic) hallucinations that has been carried out and to integrate this research within a general framework. The available evidence suggests that hallucinations result from a failure of the metacognitive skills involved in discriminating between self-generated and external sources of information. It is likely that different aspects of these skills are implicated in different types of hallucinatory experiences. Further research should focus on specific metacognitive deficits associated with different types of hallucinations and on treatment strategies designed to train hallucinators to reattribute thoughts to themselves.",,"cognition; hallucination; human; mental stress; model; psychosis; review; stimulation; Cognition; Hallucinations; Human; Models, Psychological; Physical Stimulation; Psychotic Disorders; Stress, Psychological",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Bentall, R.P.; Sub-department of Clinical Psychology, Ashton Street, Post Office Box 147, Liverpool, L69 3 BX England, United Kingdom",,,,,,,,00332909,,PSBUA,"2404293","English","Psychol.

This article therefore examines the attributions or explanations that spouses make for marital events. A review indicates that dissatisfied spouses, compared with satisfied spouses, make attributions for the partner's behavior that cast it in a negative light. Experimental, clinical outcome, and longitudinal data suggest further that attributions may influence marital satisfaction. Rival hypotheses for these findings are examined. Because continued empirical development in this domain depends on conceptual progress, a framework is presented that integrates attributions, behavior, and marital satisfaction. This framework points to several topics that require systematic study, and specific hypotheses are offered for research on these topics. It is concluded that the promising start made toward understanding marital attributions holds considerable potential for enriching behavioral conceptions of marriage.",,"cognition; control; female; human; male; marriage; model; perception; review; self concept; Cognition; Female; Human; Internal-External Control; Male; Marriage; Models, Psychological; Self Concept; Social Perception; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.; Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",,,,,"National Institute of Mental Health, NIMH: R01MH044078",,,,,,,,,,,,"Bradbury, T.N.; University of Illinois at Urbana, Champaign, United States",,,,,,,,00332909,,PSBUA,"2404292","English","Psychol.

The comments appear directed at defending an earlier meta-analysis (Priouleau, Murdock, & Brody, 1983) that concluded that psychotherapy was not more efficacious than a placebo control. We agree with Brody regarding the need for increased use of the heteromethod approach and longer follow-up for psychotherapy studies. However, we do not agree that the 10 studies Brody selected do not support the effectiveness of behavior therapy relative to placebo controls. Although a set of 10 studies is probably too small to allow robust conclusions, we noted a median effect size of .63 for those studies of neurotic conditions, relative to a placebo control. These results were very similar to our overall findings from 69 studies. Furthermore, available follow-up data suggest moderate effect sizes exist for those studies. We also comment on the existence of Type I and Type II errors of inference in reviews and meta-analyses.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Bowers, T., Clum, G., Relative contributions of specific and nonspecific treatment effects: Meta-analysis of placebo-controlled behavior therapy research (1988) Psychological Bulletin, 103, pp. 315-323; Brody, N., Behavior therapy versus placebo: Commentary on Bowers and Gum's meta-analysis (1990) Psychological Bulletin, 107, pp. 106-109; Fiske, D.W., The meta-analytic revolution in outcome research (1983) Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology, 51, pp. 65-70; Glass, G.V., Reinhold, R.M., An apology for research integration in the study of psychotherapy (1983) Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology, 51, pp. 28-41; Kirkley, B.G., Schneider, J.A., Agras, W.S., Bachman, J.S., Comparison of two group treatments for bulimia (1985) Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology, 53, pp. 43-48; Landman, J., Dawes, R., Psychotherapy outcome: Smith and Glass's conclusions stand up under scrutiny (1982) American Psychologist, 37, pp. 504-516; Lipsky, M.J., Kassinove, H., Miller, N.J., Effects of rational-emotive therapy, rational role reversal, and rational-emotive imagery on the emotional adjustment of community mental health center patients (1980) Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology, 48, pp. 366-374; McLean, P., Hakstian, R., Clinical depression: Comparative efficacy of outpatient treatments (1979) Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology, 47, pp. 818-836; Pekarik, G., The use of treatment termination status and duration patterns as an indicator of treatment effectiveness (1986) Evaluation and Program Planning, 9, pp. 25-30; Pillay, M., Crisp, A., The impact of social skills training within an established in-patient treatment program for anorexia nervosa (1981) British Journal of Psychiatry, 139, pp. 533-539; Prioleau, L., Murdock, M., Brody, N., An analysis of psychotherapy versus placebo studies (1983) The Behavioral Brain Sciences, 6, pp. 275-310; Robinson, L.A., Berman, J.S., Neimeyer, R.A., (1988) Psychotherapy for the Treatment of Depression: A Comprehensive Review of Controlled Outcome Research, , June Paper presented at the annual meeting of the Society for Psychotherapy Research, Santa Fe, NM; Shapiro, D., Shapiro, D., Comparative therapy outcome research: Methodological implications of meta-analysis (1983) Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology, 51, pp. 42-53; Smith, M.L., Glass, E.V., Meta-analysis of psychotherapy outcome studies (1977) American Psychologist, 32, pp. 752-761; Wilson, G.T., Rachman, S.J., Meta-analysis and the evaluation of psychotherapy outcome: Limitations and liabilities (1983) Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology, 51, pp. 54-64; Wilson, P., Combined pharmacological and behavioral treatment of depression (1982) Behavior Research and Therapy, 20, pp. 173-184","Clum, G.A.; Department of Psychology, , Blacksburg, VA 24061, United States",,,"American Psychological Association Inc.",,,,,00332909,,PSBUA,,"English","Psychol.

This article presents a 2-component model within which the literature regarding impression management is reviewed. This model conceptualizes impression management as being composed of 2 discrete processes. The 1st involves impression motivation-the degree to which people are motivated to control how others see them. Impression motivation is conceptualized as a function of 3 factors: the goal-relevance of the impressions one creates, the value of desired outcomes, and the discrepancy between current and desired images. The 2nd component involves impression construction. Five factors appear to determine the kinds of impressions people try to construct: the self-concept, desired and undesired identity images, role constraints, target's values, and current social image. The 2-component model provides coherence to the literature in the area, addresses controversial issues, and supplies a framework for future research regarding impression management.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Leary, M.R.; Wake Forest UniversityUnited States",,,,,,,,00332909,,PSBUA,,"English","Psychol.

In response, we present substantial evidence that the use of judges to define variables is a common tool in psychology and, when used within meta-analyses, consistently meets the relevant criteria of convergent and discriminant trait validity as well as construct validity. In addition to the 17 nonsupportive tests of the NSR model that we initially reported, multiple new tests based directly on the more objective criteria that Cialdini and Fultz stipulate for defining NSR variables also fail to support their model. New data they presented to challenge the discriminant validity of judges' ratings are shown to be based on both methodologically and conceptually flawed procedures. Finally, they reported a (nonsignificant) positive correlation between sadness-manipulation check effect sizes and helpfulness effect sizes, in support of the NSR model.

In response to their claim that outcome-relevant and value-relevant involvement are best reduced to a single construct, we assert that this proposal fails to account for existing research findings and provides only a highly speculative account of the processes that might mediate the impact of involvement on persuasion. We then reaffirm our earlier conclusion that the effects of outcome-relevant involvement are especially unstable when messages contain weak arguments.

Researchers have expressed concern over the influence of sample size on measures of fit. Many contradictory claims have been made regarding which fit statistics are affected by N. Part of the confusion is due to there being two types of sample size effects that are confounded. The first is whether N directly enters the calculation of a fit measure. The second is whether the means of the sampling distributions of a fit index are associated with sample size.

However, these aspects of leadership style were somewhat gender stereotypic in the two other classes of leadership studies investigated, namely (a) laboratory experiments and (b) assessment studies, which were defined as research that assessed the leadership styles of people not selected for occupancy of leadership roles. Consistent with stereotypic expectations about a different aspect of leadership style, the tendency to lead democratically or autocratically, women tended to adopt a more democratic or participative style and a less autocratic or directive style than did men.

It is assumed that the reader has been exposed to the general area of log-linear models, is familiar with dummy and effect coding of categorical variables in the usual regression framework, and knows how to express models in matrix form. A brief summary of the standard approach to log-linear models and of coding methods is provided for readers needing a review.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Rindskopf, D.; Program in Educational Psychology, 33 West 42nd Street, New York, NY 10036, United States",,,,,,,,00332909,,PSBUA,,"English","Psychol.

(b) Its narrow scope excludes numerous singificant issues of interest to social comparison research today.

A critical co-constructivist framework is proposed for conceptualizing the role that debate over values plays in all science. Using the psychological literature on moral development, it is shown that although debate over values is an integral part of all scientific discourse, it plays a more explicit role in fields within the human sciences (e.g., anthropology, psychology, sociology, etc.) that touch on moral phenomena. Debate over values thus raises a central issue for modern science, namely the need to develop consensually agreed-on methods for resolving such debate.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Aquinas, T., Summa theologica (1945) Basic Writings of Saint Thomas Aquinas, pp. 5-950. , A.

We review 25 published studies that have reported, usually as an incidental finding, the adaptational impact of blaming others for threatening events. Blaming others for one's misfortune is associated with impairments in emotional well-being and physical health Five potential explanations for this relation are examined. Three are derived from a psychoanalytic perspective that views blaming others as a developmental diathesis. The other two-learned helplessness and excuse theory-come from the social psychology literature. We demonstrate that none of these theories explain the observed pattern of findings and that the evidence to date poses some genuine challenges to psychodynamic and social psychological theories of adaptation to life crises We then present a model that differentiates situational factors and personal characteristics influencing the occasion for blaming others from intrapersonal and interpersonal factors that make such blaming maladaptive.

We argue that although 2 distinct research traditions of involvement have emerged, our original position that the 2 categories of involvement induce similar processes in persuasion situations remains viable. Evidence from Johnson and Eagly's meta-analysis shows that as both types of involvement increase, argument quality becomes a more important determinant of attitudes. The greater message rejection found with involvement in value as compared with outcome studies can be explained in terms of confounding factors.

Particular attention is paid to the conceptual redundancy rule that Smith, Glass, and Miller (1980) used in their study of the effectiveness of psychotherapy for deciding which effect sizes should and should not be counted in determining an overall effect size. Data from a random sample of 25 studies from Smith et al.'s (1980) population of psychotherapy outcome studies were first recoded and then reanalyzed meta-analytically. Using the conceptual redundancy rule, three coders independently coded effect sizes and identified more than twice as many of them per study as did Smith et al.

The association does not always seem due to an absence of parenting skills but more so due to a stress-induced deficiency in maternal attention. Some mothers, who also live in the midst of stressors, are not in synchrony with cues offered through their children's various behaviors. The literature suggests that the stress-induced attention problem is mediated by organizational properties of a mother's response repertoire. These properties, conceptualized by the term response class, refer to covariations among the various behaviors composing the mother's repertoire. According to this interbehavioral model, mothers who manifest high response class intercorrelations will also be most susceptible to the attention-debilitating influences of stress. The heuristic value of this model is outlined in a section on clinical strategies geared to changing a mother's attention.

In particular, law enforcement and mental health professions alike seek ways to prevent sex offenders from repeating their criminal behavior. Some evidence suggests sex offenders often continue offending even after incarceration or clinical treatment. However, recidivism rates for sex offenders are unusually hard to establish, owing to gross underreporting of sex crimes. This article presents a comprehensive review of empirical studies of sex offender recidivism. It brings together data from a wide variety of studies on both treated and untreated sex offenders of all types. Because of the variety and gravity of methodological problems in these studies, guidelines are discussed for sample selection and description, study design, criterion assessment, and data analysis. With these methodological principles in mind, the results of some 42 studies are examined for what they can tell us about sex offender recidivism and efforts to reduce it.",,"criminal law; human; male; methodology; psychotherapy; recurrent disease; review; sexual crime; sexual deviation; Criminal Law; Human; Male; Paraphilias; Psychotherapy; Recurrence; Research Design; Sex Offenses",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Furby, L.; Eugene Research Institute, 474 Willamette Street, Suite 310, Eugene, OR 97401, United States",,,,,,,,00332909,,PSBUA,"2648438","English","Psychol.

Accordingly, two general paradigms are distinguished addressing accuracy from realistic and phenomenal perspectives.

To reassess this belief, we located 165 studies that reported data on gender differences in verbal ability. The weighted mean effect size (d) was +0.11, indicating a slight female superiority in performance. The difference is so small that we argue that gender differences in verbal ability no longer exist. Analyses of effect sizes for different measures of verbal ability showed almost all to be small in magnitude: for vocabulary, d = 0.02; for analogies, d = -0.16 (slight male superiority in performance); for reading comprehension, d = 0.03; for speech production, d = 0.33 (the largest effect size); for essay writing, d = 0.09; for anagrams, d = 0.22; and for tests of general verbal ability, d = 0.20. For the 1985 administration of the Scholastic Aptitude Test-Verbal, d = -0.11, indicating superior male performance. Analysis of tests requiring different cognitive processes involved in verbal ability yielded no evidence of substantial gender differences in any aspect of processing. Similarly, an analysis by age indicated no striking changes in the magnitude of gender differences at different ages, countering Maccoby and Jacklin's (1974) conclusion that gender differences in verbal ability emerge around age 11. For studies published in 1973 or earlier, d = 0.23 and for studies published after 1973, d = 0.10, indicating a slight decline in the magnitude of the gender difference in recent years.

Testing Kendall's τ proceeds in an almost uniform way and seldom leads to erroneous conclusions. For N &gt; 20, the exact test can be replaced by an approximate z test. Testing Spearman's rS varies from textbook to textbook. Some textbooks present tables with significant values that are in error; this seems partly due to the discrete character of rS. The well-known Statistical Package for the Social Sciences computer package presents false results, both for τ and for rS, when N is small.

The mechanism of at least the longer phase is the activation of features in long-term memory, comparable to the mechanism of non-sensory, short-term storage.

Unfortunately, most of the ATI research to date has been characterized by the use of an inappropriate methodology. Therefore, some general methodological issues with regard to ATI research are outlined. The literature encompassing cognitive and/or behavioral treatments for anxiety, depression, pain, obesity, and tobacco dependence is then reviewed. This examination reveals little consistency in the emergence of individual differences relevant to treatment responsiveness. There are some indications that it may be possible to distinguish two (broadly defined) groups of individuals: those with active and those with less active coping styles. The former group appears to fare better in treatments that emphasize self-control rather than therapist control. In addition, the distinction between visually and verbally based coping strategies has been shown in some cases to predict response to visually or verbally based therapies.

The review suggests that whereas there is little evidence in adults of a cognitive vulnerability to clinical depression, disturbances in interpersonal functioning may be antecedents or sequelae of this disorder. Specifically, marital distress and low social integration appear to be involved in the etiology of depression, and introversion and interpersonal dependency are identified as enduring abnormalities in the functioning of remitted depressives.

In primary self-destruction, the person foresees and desires harm to self; in tradeoffs, the harm is foreseen but not desired; and in counterproductive strategies, the harm is neither foreseen nor desired. We review 12 categories of self-defeating behavior patterns from the research literature in social psychology. No clear evidence of primary self-destruction is found. Several tradeoff patterns have been shown: Typically, the individual favors short-term benefits despite long-term costs and risks, especially under the influence of aversive emotional states and high self-awareness. Counterproductive strategies have also been found, usually based on misjudging self or misjudging contingencies. It is concluded that normal people do harm themselves and defeat their projects by means of poor judgments, by maladaptive responses, through unforeseen consequences of nonoptimal methods, and by disregarding costs and risks in favor of immediate pleasure or relief; however, there is no clear evidence of intentional, deliberate self-destructiveness among normal (nonclinical) individuals. © 1988 American Psychological Association.",,"adaptive behavior; human; mental disease; psychological aspect; review; self concept; Adaptation, Psychological; Human; Mental Disorders; Self Concept; Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",,,,,"National Institute of Mental Health, NIMH: T32MH018021",,,,,,,,,,,,"Baumeister, R.F.; Department of Psychology, , Cleveland, OH 44106, United States",,,,,,,,00332909,,PSBUA,"3043527","English","Psychol.

The inverted-∪ hypothesis is supported only in a weak and psychologically trivial fashion: Subjects with incentive will outperform either those with none or those responding to a serious and plausible threat; the arousal level of the first group will be intermediate to those of the other two. However, debilitating states (e.g., anxiety) can occur at arousal levels equal to that optimal for performance (the state of being ""psyched up""). The concept of arousal cannot distinguish between these and other states (e.g., anger, sexuality, and fear) because it is an excessively broad physiological construct artificially severed from its psychological context. More useful research in human motor performance would investigate discrete psychobiological states, which include affect and cognition as well as physiology. Examination of profound individual differences in response to incentive and threat suggests that psychobiological states have their genesis in response expectancies and hypnotic-like self-inductions. The cognitive and affective components of these states are highly interactive and perhaps not profitably separated. Because performance anxiety is a central problem in the motor realm, it is carefully delineated and the test anxiety literature is scrutinized. Psychophysiological test batteries and other investigations in the area are described, and guidelines for future research are provided.",,"anxiety; arousal; cognition; human; leisure; physiology; psychological aspect; psychomotor performance; reaction time; review; Anxiety; Arousal; Cognition; Human; Psychomotor Performance; Reaction Time; Relaxation",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Neiss, R.; Children's Hospital Oakland, 747 52nd Street, Oakland, CA 94609, United States",,,,,,,,00332909,,PSBUA,"3289072","English","Psychol.

For all three measures, independence between raters is assumed in deriving the proportion of agreement expected by chance. Scott's π involves a further assumption of homogeneous rater marginals, and the S coefficient requires the assumption of uniform marginal distributions for both raters. Because of these disparate formulations, κ, π, and S can lead to different conclusions about rater agreement.

Schemata about the self are considered an important feature in cognitive accounts of depression maintenance and enduring vulnerability. In this article, I attempt to clarify the role of self-schemata in cognitive models of depression and to evaluate the empirical support for this notion according to criteria consonant with this construct's usage in cognitive psychology and social cognition. Whereas the concept of a negative self-schema was initially proposed as a distal cognitive diathesis to depressive disorder, measurement problems have hindered a meaningful test of this construct's predictive capacity. Furthermore, conceptual and design-related confounds in extant depressive-schema studies prevent the demonstration of schematic processing independent of the effects of depressed mood on the dependent variables used. It is argued that reconceptualizing self-schema in cognitive-structural terms may help address and resolve some of these current problems. For example, methods used to assess more general knowledge structures, such as semantic networks, might be profitably used to verify whether information about the self is similarly organized. This can then begin the process of specifying the exact nature of the information thought to be stored within this structure and allow researchers to move beyond a simple dichotomy of positive and negative elements to models that better reflect the complexity of self-construal.",,"cognition; depression; human; psychological aspect; psychological theory; review; self concept; Cognition; Depressive Disorder; Human; Psychological Theory; Self Concept; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Segal, Z.V.; Cognitive and Behavior Therapies Section, , Toronto, Ont., Canada",,,,,,,,00332909,,PSBUA,"3283811","English","Psychol.

Research suggests that causal processing first occurs around 3 months of age, in perception of motion continuity across two objects, as in one ball colliding with another. The temporal limit to the perception of continuity and, hence, causal relation may be set by the temporal integration function of iconic processing. Events of this kind may form the basis for the use of the cues of temporal contiguity, spatial contiguity, temporal order, and similarity in causal processing at later ages and higher levels. The same cues underlie causal processing of event relations made for functional reasons between plans or intentions and behavioral outcomes. Causal processing is probably automatic, rather than controlled, to begin with. Other suggestions for the origins of causal processing include concrete, familiar event sequences; human intended action; generative relations; and observation of regularity and covariation. Evidence suggests that each of these plays a role in the development of causal processing.

The usual partial reinforcement extinction effect, demonstrating greater resistance to extinction after intermittent than after continuous reinforcement, seems to contradict this generalization. However, most free-operant extinction data are reported as response totals, which confound the initial levels of responding and the rate at which responding decreases over the course of extinction. A reanalysis shows that after extended training, the slope of the extinction curve is shallower after continuous reinforcement than after intermittent reinforcement, suggesting greater rather than less resistance to change. These results, which hold for both independent-groups and within-subject comparisons, support the general finding that resistance to change of free-operant behavior is a positive function of the rate of reinforcement. This generalization does not, however, hold for discrete-trial performance.

Furthermore, it is assumed that the systematic variation is dictated by a set of personal or situational variables that are known and observable. We demonstrate that these assumptions allow one to aggregate data across DMUs and yet estimate an idiosyncratic set of parameters for each DMU. A significant aspect of the output of the approach is the ability to assess the relative impact of the personal and situational variables on each DMU's parameter values.

Respondents first interpret the attitude question, determining what attitude the question is about. They then retrieve relevant beliefs and feelings. Next, they apply these beliefs and feelings in rendering the appropriate judgment. Finally, they use this judgment to select a response. All four of the component processes can be affected by prior items. The prior items can provide a framework for interpreting later questions and can also make some responses appear to be redundant with earlier answers. The prior items can prime some beliefs, making them more accessible to the retrieval process. The prior items can suggest a norm or standard of comparison for making the judgment. Finally, the prior items can create consistency pressures or pressures to appear moderate.

The philosophical objections to moral psychology are discussed, including (a) the naturalistic fallacy, (b) the implications of teleological and deontological analyses, (c) the problem of scope, (d) confusions in everyday moral language, (e) sociocultural and sociohistorical analysis, and (f) noncognitivism and irrationalism. Two suggestions are offered concerning how empirical evidence may appropriately be introduced into the process of ethical inquiry. First, research may be used to evaluate claims regarding human nature in the moral realm. Second, empirical evidence can be used to assess the factual status of teleological moral claims.

In this review we integrate these bodies of research and address the interdependent issues of the nature of phonological abilities and their causal roles in the acquisition of reading skills. Phonological ability seems to be general across tasks that purport to measure the three kinds of phonological processing, and this generality apparently is independent of general cognitive ability. However, the generality of phonological ability is not complete, and there is an empirical basis for distinguishing phonological awareness and phonetic recoding in working memory. Our review supports a causal role for phonological awareness in learning to read, and suggests the possibility of similar causal roles for phonological recoding in lexical access and phonetic recoding in working memory. Most researchers have neglected the probable causal role of learning to read in the development of phonological skills. It is no longer enough to ask whether phonological skills play a causal role in the acquisition of reading skills. The question now is which aspects of phonological processing (e.g., awareness, recoding in lexical access, recoding in working memory) are causally related to which aspects of reading (e.g., word recognition, word analysis, sentence comprehension), at which point in their codevelopment, and what are the directions of these causal relations? © 1987 American Psychological Association.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Wagner, R.K.; Florida State UniversityUnited States",,,,,,,,00332909,,PSBUA,,"English","Psychol.

In the present article, I review 60 years of empirical studies that have investigated whether there is a reinstatement of childhood psychological or physiological faculties during hypnotic age regression. Results suggest that if regression is defined as the extent to which hypnotized subjects conform to childhood norms and control subjects do not, then the mental and physiological activity of hypnotically age-regressed subjects is not regressed; it appears to be essentially adult. Although findings might be more compatible with a broader definition of regression as the appearance of primitive mentation or the use of less sequential modes of information processing during hypnosis, there is no evidence for a literal reinstatement of childhood functioning during hypnotic-age-regression procedures. © 1987 American Psychological Association.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Nash, M.; University of TennesseeUnited States",,,,,,,,00332909,,PSBUA,,"English","Psychol.

I also use developments in quantitative analysis procedures to approach previous data in a single, unbiased framework for evaluation. Two major sources of data and discussion are reanalyzed and critically evaluated. One source concerns the changes in interindividual between-subjects variability with task practice. The other main source of data and theory pertains to associations between intellectual abilities and task performance during skill acquisition. Early studies of practice and variability yielded mixed results regarding the convergence or divergence of individual differences with practice. Other studies regarding intelligence and skill learning indicated small or trivial correlations between individual differences in intelligence and ""gain"" scores. More recent studies indicated small correlations between performance measures on skill learning tasks and standard intellectual and cognitive ability measures, as well as increasing amounts of task-specific variance over learning trials. On the basis of this reanalysis and reexamination, these data confirm the proposition that individuals converge on performance as tasks become less dependent on attentional resources with practice. Further, it is determined that when appropriate methodological techniques are used and crucial task characteristics are taken into account, intellectual abilities play a substantial part in determining individual differences in skill learning. © 1987 American Psychological Association.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Ackerman, P.L.; University of MinnesotaUnited States",,,,,,,,00332909,,PSBUA,,"English","Psychol.

The article begins with a framework for conceptualizing and assessing children's peer difficulties and with a discussion of conceptual and methodological issues in longitudinal risk research. Following this, three indexes of problematic peer relationships (acceptance, aggressiveness, and shyness/withdrawal) are evaluated as predictors of three later outcomes (dropping out of school, criminality, and psychopathology). The relation between peer difficulties and later maladjustment is examined in terms of both the consistency and strength of prediction. A review and analysis of the literature indicates general support for the hypothesis that children with poor peer adjustment are at risk for later life difficulties. Support is clearest for the outcomes of dropping out and criminality. It is also clearest for low acceptance and aggressiveness as predictors, whereas a link between shyness/withdrawal and later maladjustment has not yet been adequately tested.

We show that these indicants provide shape descriptions of nonnegative bounded waveforms and present evidence suggesting that moment-based indicants offer a mathematically rigorous yet easily interpretable summary of bioelectric signals in the time, amplitude, and frequency domains. Advantages and limitations of using the moment-based indicants to compare responses are discussed. © 1987 American Psychological Association.",,"arousal; electroencephalography; electromyography; human; physiology; psychophysiology; research; review; Arousal; Electroencephalography; Electromyography; Human; Psychophysiology; Research; Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Cacioppo, J.T.; University of IowaUnited States",,,,,,,,00332909,,PSBUA,"3317469","English","Psychol.

Research in this area was stopped by a critique of global accuracy scores by Cronbach and Gage. They argued that accuracy should be measured in terms of components. Currently, interest in the topic of accuracy is rekindling. This interest is motivated, in part, by a reaction to the bias literature. We argue that modern accuracy research should (a) focus on measuring when and how people are accurate and not on who is accurate, (b) use each person as both judge and target, and (c) partition accuracy into components. The social relations model (Kenny & La Voie, 1984) can be used as a paradigm to meet these requirements. According to this model, there are four types of accuracy, only two of which are generally conceptually interesting. The first, called individual accuracy, measures the degree to which people's judgments of an individual correspond to how that individual tends to behave across interaction partners. The second, called dyadic accuracy, measures the degree to which people can uniquely judge how a specific individual will behave with them. We present an example that shows high levels of individual accuracy and lower levels of dyadic accuracy. © 1987 American Psychological Association.",,"human; human relation; perception; review; Human; Interpersonal Relations; Social Perception; Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",,,,,"National Institute of Mental Health, NIMH: R01MH040295",,,,,,,,,,,,"Kenny, D.A.; University of ConnecticutUnited States",,,,,,,,00332909,,PSBUA,"3317468","English","Psychol.

We reviewed studies about children of alcoholic parents published between 1975 and 1985 to clarify the relation between parental alcoholism and child psychopathology. We identified methodological problems in this body of literature and organized substantive findings around eight areas of outcome: (a) hyperactivity and conduct disorder; (b) substance abuse, delinquency, and truancy; (c) cognitive functioning; (d) social inadequacy; (e) somatic problems; (f) anxiety and depressive symptoms; (g) physical abuse; and (h) dysfunctional family interactions. The literature as a whole supported the contention that parental alcoholism is associated with a heightened incidence of child symptoms of psychopathology, in comparison with no increased incidence in offspring of nondisturbed parents. However, neither all nor a major portion of the population of children from alcoholic homes are inevitably doomed to childhood psychological disorder. We discuss the pattern of findings in the light of issues of causality, child resiliency, and potential qualifying factors, such as variations in family disruption, and we offer recommendations regarding methodological improvements, possible mediating variables, and a multiple-risk conceptualization. © 1987 American Psychological Association.",,"alcoholism; child; child parent relation; human; mental disease; psychological aspect; review; risk factor; Alcoholism; Child; Human; Mental Disorders; Parent-Child Relations; Psychopathology; Risk Factors",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Prinz, R.J.; University of South CarolinaUnited States",,,,,,,,00332909,,PSBUA,"3310059","English","Psychol.

We propose that depression occurs after the loss of an important source of self-worth when an individual becomes stuck in a self-regulatory cycle in which no responses to reduce the discrepancy between actual and desired states are available. Consequently, the individual falls into a pattern of virtually constant self-focus, resulting in intensified negative affect, self-derogation, further negative outcomes, and a depressive self-focusing style in which he or she self-focuses a great deal after negative outcomes but very little after positive outcomes. Eventually, these factors lead to a negative self-image, which may take on value by providing an explanation for the individual's plight and by helping the individual avoid further disappointments. The depressive self-focusing style then maintains and exacerbates the depressive disorder.

A meta-analysis, or quantitative review, was performed to integrate and organize the results of studies that investigated certain personality variables in relation to CHD. The personality variables included were anger, hostility, aggression, depression, extroversion, anxiety, Type A, and the major components of Type A. The meta-analytic framework helps focus attention on issues needing clarification. The results indicate that modest but reliable associations exist between some of the personality variables and CHD. The strongest associations were found for Type A and, surprisingly, for depression, but anger/hostility/aggression and anxiety also related reliably to CHD. The Structured Interview diagnosis of Type A was shown to be clearly superior to the Jenkins Activity Survey as a predictor of CHD. The Type A-CHD relation was smaller in prospective than in cross-sectional studies and smaller in recent than in less recent studies. This review also revealed that information about the interrelations of personality predictors of CHD is sorely needed. The picture of coronary-proneness revealed by this review is not one of a hurried, impatient workaholic but instead is one of a person with one or more negative emotions. We suggest that the concept of the coronary-prone personality and its associated research be broadened to encompass psychological attributes in addition to those associated with Type A behavior and narrowed to eliminate those components that the accumulated evidence shows to be unimportant. © 1987 American Psychological Association.",,"article; coronary artery disease; human; personality test; psychological aspect; risk; type A behavior; Coronary Disease; Human; Personality Tests; Risk; Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; Type A Personality",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Friedman, H.S.; University of California, Riverside, United States",,,,,,,,00332909,,PSBUA,"3602244","English","Psychol.

Factor analyses typically yield distinct but correlated dimensions in the areas of hyperactivity and conduct problems/aggression; separate factors of inattention are sometimes found. Evidence attesting to the divergent validity of such empirical factors is accumulating. Furthermore, recent studies provide support for the separation of aggressive, hyperactive, and aggressive-hyperactive subgroups of children. In sum, although full syndromal independence has not been established, considerable merit exists in considering the domains as partially independent. Furthermore, because of contaminated samples, much of the existing validational research on hyperactivity and conduct disorders is inconclusive.

Biological preparedness is postulated to be responsible for the rapid acquisition, irrationality, belongingness, and high resistance to extinction considered characteristic of phobias. Psychophysiological experiments testing this theory have involved comparisons between fear-relevant stimuli (e.g., slides of snakes) and fear-irrelevant stimuli (e.g., slides of flowers) as conditioned stimuli in Pavlovian aversive conditioning paradigms. Researchers have predicted that autonomic responses conditioned to fear-relevant stimuli should mimic the aforementioned characteristics of phobias. The evidence most consistent with the theory is the enhanced resistance to extinction of electrodermal responses established to fear-relevant stimuli. Hypotheses regarding ease of acquisition, irrationality, and belongingness have received either only minimal or equivocal support. Alternative explanations are discussed for the resistance to extinction effect, the conceptual basis of preparedness theory, and its clinical implications. © 1987 American Psychological Association.",,"arousal; article; conditioned reflex; fear; human; learning; phobia; psychological aspect; Arousal; Conditioning, Classical; Fear; Human; Phobic Disorders; Set (Psychology)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"McNally, R.J.; University of Health Sciences, United States",,,,,,,,00332909,,PSBUA,"3562708","English","Psychol.

Moreover, this research attracts a great deal of attention because of what many take to be its dismal implications for the accuracy of human social reasoning. These implications are illusory, however, because an error is not the same thing as a ""mistake."" An error is a judgment of an experimental stimulus that departs from a model of the judgment process. If this model is normative, then the error can be said to represent an incorrect judgment. A mistake, by contrast, is an incorrect judgment of a real-world stimulus and therefore more difficult to determine. Although errors can be highly informative about the process of judgment in general, they are not necessarily relevant to the content or accuracy of particular judgments, because errors in a laboratory may not be mistakes with respect to a broader, more realistic frame of reference and the processes that produce such errors might lead to correct decisions and adaptive outcomes in real life.

On the basis of this review, a model is presented that tries to reconcile the varied findings encountered in the literature. Specifically, this model proposes that memory processes in these disorders result from the operation of two diagnostically nonspecific mechanisms, mood state and severity of psychopathology. Mood state is thought to affect memory in two related ways: (a) by activating a negative self-schema that is responsible for the selective encoding and retrieval of information congruent with the current state, and (b) by providing contextual cues that result in the activation of mood-state-congruent memory associations. The effect of severity of pathology is also proposed to occur via one or both of two possible routes: (a) by disrupting trace processing and storage by its disorganizational nature, and/or (b) by producing low levels of effort in encoding and storage. © 1987 American Psychological Association.",,"article; bipolar disorder; cognitive defect; depression; human; memory; psychological aspect; recall; Bipolar Disorder; Cognition Disorders; Depressive Disorder; Human; Memory; Mental Recall",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Johnson, M.H.; Ohio State UniversityUnited States",,,,,,,,00332909,,PSBUA,"3562703","English","Psychol.

The probability of making a Type I error can be characterized in the following three ways: the conditional prior probability (the probability of making a Type I error whenever a true null hypothesis is tested), the overall prior probability (the probability of making a Type I error across all experiments), and the conditional posterior probability (the probability of having made a Type I error in situations in which the null hypothesis is rejected). In this article, we show (a) that the alpha level can be equated with the first of these and (b) that it provides an upper bound for the second but (c) that it does not provide an estimate of the third, although it is commonly assumed to do so. We trace the source of this erroneous assumption first to statistical texts used by psychologists, which are generally ambiguous about which of the three interpretations is intended at any point in their discussions of Type I errors and which typically confound the conditional prior and posterior probabilities. Underlying this, however, is a more general fallacy in reasoning about probabilities, and we suggest that this may be the result of erroneous inferences about probabilistic conditional statements. Finally, we consider the possibility of estimating the (posterior) probability of a Type I error in situations in which the null hypothesis is rejected and, hence, the proportion of statistically significant results that may be Type I errors. © 1987 American Psychological Association.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Pollard, P.; School of Psychology, , Preston, Lancashire, United Kingdom",,,,,,,,00332909,,PSBUA,,"English","Psychol.

A historical survey of the reminiscence literature is presented, and it is concluded that the decline in interest in the phenomenon during the 1930s and 1940s was partly attributable to changes in how reminiscence was defined and conceptualized. Recent experimental work that has renewed interest in the hypermnesia phenomenon is reviewed, along with two theoretical explications of hypermnesia and the attempts to test them. However, neither theoretical interpretation provides a complete account of hypermnesia. Finally, the experimental literature on repeated testing is examined in order to ascertain which factors affect the likelihood of obtaining hypermnesia. Among the primary factors that apparently affect hypermnesia are the type of study items (pictures produce greater hypermnesia than words) and the length of the recall periods used, with longer recall periods being more likely to produce hypermnesia than shorter periods. Because hypermnesia in the repeated test paradigm depends on both the rate of item recovery and the rate of intertest forgetting, future research should consider more closely the factors that affect interest forgetting and the recovery of new items. © 1987 American Psychological Association.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Payne, D.G.; State University of New York at BinghamtonUnited States",,,,,,,,00332909,,PSBUA,,"English","Psychol.

This two-stage conceptualization, illustrated with data on Head Start children, allows investigators to model individual change, predict future development, assess the quality of measurement instruments for distinguishing among growth trajectories, and to study systematic variation in growth trajectories as a function of background characteristics and experimental treatments. © 1987 American Psychological Association.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Bryk, A.S.; Department of Education, United States",,,,,,,,00332909,,PSBUA,,"English","Psychol.

In order to sustain the argument against direct regression (or its nonparametric analogue), one must be willing to assume that true quality of performance influences salary over and above the influence of measures of performance.

In social psychological studies, helping behavior has been examined in the context of short-term encounters with strangers. This focus has tended to exclude from the research literature those helping behaviors prescribed by the female gender role, because they are displayed primarily in long-term, close relationships. In contrast, the helping behaviors prescribed by the male gender role have been generously represented in research findings because they are displayed in relationships with strangers as well as in close relationships. Results from our meta-analytic review of sex differences in helping behavior indicate that in general men helped more than women and women received more help than men. Nevertheless, sex differences in helping were extremely inconsistent across studies and were successfully predicted by various attributes of the studies and the helping behaviors. These predictors were interpreted in terms of several aspects of our social-role theory of gender and helping. © 1986 American Psychological Association.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Eagly, A.H.; Purdue University",,,,,,,,00332909,,PSBUA,,"English","Psychol.

Because their MA-CA correlations were greater than MA-confluence model correlations in within-family samples, they concluded that the confluence model is invalid.

Yet review of the seventeenth, eighteenth, and nineteenth centuries' philosophical and physiological literature reveals specific anticipations of this idea, and of some of our prevailing views of the sleep process. These early writings have been scarcely mentioned in modern literature on sleep and dreaming, and were completely overlooked in Freud's (1913) influential review of the pre-twentieth-century scientific literature on dreams. We trace the development of this idea starting from the seventeenth century writings of Leibnitz, until the birth of psychophysiology in the second half of the nineteenth century. We argue that Leibnitz's ideas of ""petites perceptiones"" allowed his successors to explain dreaming as an endogenous product of the brain. For the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries' physiologists, petites perceptiones were engendered by a specific type of brain reflex, in which neither the stimulus nor the response reached awareness. © 1986 American Psychological Association.",,"article; dream; Europe; history; history of medicine; human; philosophy; physiology; psychophysiology; United States; Dreams; Europe; History of Medicine, 18th Cent.; History of Medicine, 19th Cent.; Human; Philosophy; Psychophysiology; United States",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Lavie, P.; Sleep Laboratory, , Haifa, Israel",,,,,,,,00332909,,PSBUA,"3532158","English","Psychol.

Research indicates that schizophrenics manifest the following cognitive ERP abnormalities relative to control subjects: (a) a diminished contingent negative variation (CNV) in warned reaction time paradigms during the warning stimulus-imperative stimulus interval; this CNV continues beyond presentation of the imperative stimulus as the postimperative negative variation (PINV). Contingent negative variation attenuation may reflect a state marker of psychosis in acute schizophrenics, whereas serving as a trait marker regardless of current symptoms in more chronic patients. In contrast, the PINV may be more of a state marker for both acute and chronic patients. (b) A pattern of P100-N100 reducing in acute schizophrenics that is not seen in chronic and paranoid patients. (c) Evidence of an attenuated enhancement of N100 (actually superimposed Nd or processing negativity) to stimuli presented in an attended channel, especially at slower event rates. (d) A diminished late positive complex (LPC) apparently due more to a diminished P300 than a diminished slow wave. The LPC attenuation in schizophrenics may to a degree reflect a trait marker of high risk for schizophrenia as well as a residual deficit state that often remains following the remission of positive symptoms. (e) Finally, with the possible exception of the PINV elicited in standard CNV paradigms, these ERP abnormalities do not appear to be specific to schizophrenia, as they are found in association with a variety of other disorders as well. The implication of each of these abnormalities for the conceptualization of the schizophrenic disorder is discussed, as is the ""impaired performance"" problem associated with doing ERP research with clinical groups. © 1986 American Psychological Association.",,"neuroleptic agent; acute disease; brain; child; cognition; drug effect; electroencephalography; evoked auditory response; evoked response; female; habituation; human; male; mood disorder; paranoid schizophrenia; parietal lobe; pathophysiology; physiology; reaction time; review; schizophrenia; Acute Disease; Antipsychotic Agents; Brain; Child; Cognition; Electroencephalography; Evoked Potentials; Evoked Potentials, Auditory; Female; Habituation (Psychophysiology); Human; Male; Mood Disorders; Parietal Lobe; Reaction Time; Schizophrenia; Schizophrenia, Paranoid",,"Antipsychotic Agents",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Pritchard, W.S.; Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, , Galveston, United States",,,,,,,,00332909,,PSBUA,"2874579","English","Psychol.

The ecological approach to social perception (McArthur & Baron, 1983) holds that facial characteristics may influence impressions if they typically reveal psychological attributes whose detection is important for adaptive functioning. For example, the facial characteristics that identify infants should reveal their helplessness. The ecological approach further predicts that a strong attunement to adaptively significant facial characteristics may be overgeneralized. In particular, it is hypothesized that adults with immature facial qualities are perceived to have childlike psychological attributes. The research we review provides strong support for this prediction. More specifically, adults with various childlike facial qualities are perceived to afford more warmth, more submission, more honesty, less physical strength, and more naivete than those with more mature faces. Implications of the ecological approach for further research on face perception are discussed. © 1986 American Psychological Association.",,"adolescent; adult; age; aged; character; child; chin; esthetics; eye; face; forehead; human; perception; preschool child; review; skin; skull; Adolescent; Adult; Age Factors; Aged; Beauty; Character; Child; Child, Preschool; Chin; Eye; Face; Forehead; Human; Middle Age; Skin; Skull; Social Perception",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Berry, D.S.; Brandeis University",,,,,,,,00332909,,PSBUA,"3526376","English","Psychol.

Various phenomena occurring in specification searches are demonstrated and discussed. Results indicate that the likelihood of success in a specification search is optimal when (a) the investigator's initial model corresponds closely to the true model, (b) the search is allowed to continue even when a statistically plausible model is obtained, (c) the investigator can place valid restrictions on permissible modifications, and (d) a large sample is used.

Subsequent analyses were conducted to determine the factors responsible for the heterogeneity of effects. At the highest level of analysis, alcohol expectancy had strong effects on relatively deviant social behaviors and minimal effects on nonsocial behaviors. Alcohol consumption showed the opposite pattern of effects. The principal effects associated with alcohol expectancy involved increased alcohol consumption and increased sexual arousal in response to erotic stimuli. On the other hand, alcohol consumption led to significant impairment of information processing and motor performance, induced a specific set of physical sensations, resulted in general improvements of mood, and tended to increase aggression. Finally, across all studies it was observed that alcohol consumption and expectancy interacted no more frequently than would be expected by chance.

The four components consist of an input phase in which to-be-typed text is grouped into familiar chunks, a parsing phase in which the chunks are decomposed into discrete characters, a translation phase in which characters are converted into movement specifications, and finally an execution phase in which the actual movements are produced. This framework was used to integrate 29 distinct empirical phenomena related to transcription typing, including the multiple units of typing, the existence of four major categories of errors, and differences associated with increasing skill.

We start by defining nonindependence of observations and discuss three commonly assumed patterns of nonindependence: nonindependence due to groups, nonindependence due to sequence, and nonindependence due to space. We then show how the bias in both the mean square for treatment and the mean square for error can be derived when each of the three patterns of nonindependence is ignored in analyzing the effect of a discrete independent variable. In each case we show that the bias introduced can be considerable. Further, the combined effects of the bias in each of the mean squares can lead to either too large or too small F ratios. We briefly discuss ways to eliminate the biases, either by including the source of nonindependence in the analysis, transforming the data to remove it, or modeling it. Finally, we suggest that nonindependence of observations should be looked at not simply as a statistical nuisance, but also as a substantive issue central to many areas of psychological research. © 1986 American Psychological Association.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Kenny, D.A.; Psychology Department, ",,,,,,,,00332909,,PSBUA,,"English","Psychol.

Previous treatments of eyewitness identification have not distinguished between the all-suspect model and the single-suspect model. The single-suspect model allows for the occurrence of foil identifications, a known-error category, whereas the all-suspect model does not. A Bayesian analysis of posterior probabilities of the guilt of a given suspect under various prior probabilities shows that the all-suspect model may be more or less diagnostic than the single-suspect model depending on the extent to which the use of suspects rather than foils increases the prior likelihood that the actual target is in the lineup. On the other hand, the lineup-wise error rate (which is the likelihood that any suspect will be falsely identified) is considerably higher with the all-suspect lineup. Field data show that the all-suspect lineup is sometimes used by police departments, and some data suggest that police do not appreciate the distinction between the two models with regard to lineup-wise error rates. It is recommended that either a mixed model or a preceding blank lineup be used to replace all-suspect models in actual cases. © 1986 American Psychological Association.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Wells, G.L.; University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alta., Canada",,,,,,,,00332909,,PSBUA,,"English","Psychol.

These illustrative ROCs are seen to be fitted well by a straight line, of varying slope, on a binormal graph. This result has fundamental implications for models and indices of performance. The form of empirical ROCs is consistent with one version of the variable-criterion model provided by signal detection theory, and is inconsistent both with other versions of that model and with the main threshold models. That form supports the use of certain indices of discrimination accuracy derived from detection theory, and substantiates the potential unreliability of others of that heritage and, more importantly, the unreliability of the several accuracy indices in common use that can be shown to imply one or another threshold model. The preferred detection-theory indices of accuracy are ones that accommodate the varying slope of empirical ROCs. These indices are effectively independent of the decision criterion, which can be indexed separately. Measuring both accuracy and the decision criterion appropriately enables one to delineate which of these dependent variables is affected by which independent variables in psychological studies, and to assess the efficacy as well as the accuracy of diagnostic systems. © 1986 American Psychological Association.",,"animal; aptitude test; brain disease; cognition; decision making; forensic medicine; human; information system; learning; memory; odor; perceptive discrimination; perceptive threshold; pigeon; radiography; review; scintiscanning; theoretical model; vision; weather; Animal; Aptitude Tests; Brain Diseases; Cognition; Discrimination (Psychology); Human; Information Systems; Judgment; Learning; Lie Detection; Memory; Models, Theoretical; Pigeons; Sensory Thresholds; Smell; Statistics; Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.; Visual Perception; Weather",,,,,"National Cancer Institute, NCI: R01CA033261",,,,,,,,,,,,"Swets, J.A.; BBN Laboratories Incorporated, Cambridge, MA, United States",,,,,,,,00332909,,PSBUA,"3515382","English","Psychol.

The latter is explained by (a) a paucity of research on voice quality, (b) neglect of the social signaling functions of affect vocalization, and (c) insufficiently precise conceptualization of the underlying emotional states. A ""component patterning"" model of vocal affect expression is proposed that attempts to link the outcomes of antecedent event evaluation to biologically based response patterns. On the basis of a literature survey of acoustic-phonetic evidence, the likely phonatory and articulatory correlates of the physiological responses characterizing different emotional states are described in the form of three major voice types (narrow-wide, lax-tense, full-thin). Specific predictions are made as to the changes in acoustic parameters resulting from changing voice types. These predictions are compared with the pattern of empirical findings yielded by a comprehensive survey of the literature on vocal cues in emotional expression. Although the comparison is largely limited to the tense-lax voice type (because acoustic parameters relevant to the other voice types have not yet been systematically studied), a high degree of convergence is revealed.

One hypothesis focuses on ""disinhibition"" or loss of control among dieters and the other focuses on the relations between obesity and restraint. It is concluded that the ""disinhibition hypothesis,"" which proposes that dieters overeat after disruptions in self-control, has been supported. Both perceptions of having overeaten and dysphoric mood precipitate high consumption among restrained eaters. Research is needed to establish the processes underlying these effects. It is also concluded that the ""obesity and restraint hypothesis,"" which proposes that differences in level of restraint underlie differences between obese and normal weight people's eating patterns, has not been supported. Although obese people have higher average restraint scores than normal weight people do, they do not show the disinhibited eating patterns that characterize normal weight, restrained eaters. Studies of the restraint scale have indicated that the high scores found among obese people may be due to psychometric problems in the scale. Overall, it is concluded that although the hypotheses concerning restraint, and the recent extension of them into a boundary model of food regulation, do not seem useful in understanding obesity; they appear to be relevant to understanding binge eating and related disorders, such as bulimia. © 1986 American Psychological Association.",,"alcohol; anxiety; association; attention; body weight; cognition; control; depression; eating; emotion; feeding behavior; food preference; homeostasis; human; inhibition (psychology); low calory diet; obesity; perception; psychological aspect; review; social environment; theoretical model; time perception; Anxiety; Attention; Body Weight; Cognition; Cues; Depression; Diet, Reducing; Eating; Emotions; Ethanol; Feeding Behavior; Food Preferences; Homeostasis; Human; Inhibition (Psychology); Internal-External Control; Models, Theoretical; Obesity; Perception; Social Environment; Time Perception",,"alcohol, 64-17-5; Ethanol, 64-17-5",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Ruderman, A.J.; Department of Psychology, ",,,,,,,,00332909,,PSBUA,"3515384","English","Psychol.

In many cases, however, only very small or nonexistent moderator effects have been reported from OLS-MMR analyses, even when there has been strong a priori reason to expect effects and when less powerful procedures (e.g., subgroup analyses) have produced larger effects with the same data sets (e.g., Zedeck, Cranny, Vale, & Smith, 1971). The growing body of weak and failed results may be misleading because investigators, following what has become a standard protocol, might have unknowingly used OLS-MMR under circumstances in which it is highly likely to produce Type II error. We describe a means for determining circumstances when OLS-MMR may be at risk in moderator applications, and suggest an alternative regression procedure that can be used to overcome the threat of Type II error posed by these circumstances. Using field study data, parallel analyses are presented to show how markedly different results can be obtained between OLS-MMR and the remedial procedure. Finally, we urge investigators who have reached conclusions with the traditional OLS-MMR approach to reexamine their data. © 1986 American Psychological Association.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Morris, J.H.; Naval Postgraduate School",,,,,,,,00332909,,PSBUA,,"English","Psychol.

The earlier results on additive representations are briefly surveyed. Generalizations to nonadditive structures are outlined, and their more complex uniqueness results are described. The latter leads to a definition of scale type in terms of the symmetries (automorphisms) of the underlying qualitative structure. The major result is that for any measurement onto the real numbers, only three possible scale types exist that are both rich in symmetries but not too redundant: ratio, interval, and another lying between them. The possible numerical representations for concatenation structures corresponding to these scale types are completely described. The interval scale case leads to a generalization of subjective expected-utility theory that copes with some empirical violations of the classical theory. Partial attempts to axiomatize concatenation structures of these three scale types are described. Such structures are of interest because they make clear that there is a rich class of nonadditive concatenation and conjoint structures with representations of the same scale types as those used in physics. © 1986 American Psychological Association.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Luce, R.D.; Department of Psychology and Social Relations, ",,,,,,,,00332909,,PSBUA,,"English","Psychol.

Because some offers are declined, and lower scoring candidates must be accepted in the place of higher scoring candidates who decline initial offers, the average ability of those actually selected will almost always be lower than the average ability of those who received the initial offers. As a consequence, the actual increase in utility associated with testing will generally be lower than it would be if all offers were accepted. Formulas are developed for calculating the average ability of those actually selected when the proportion of initial offers accepted is less than 100%. Three cases are considered: (a) those in which offers are declined at random, (b) those in which offers are declined by the highest scoring applicants, and (c) those in which test scores are related to the probability of accepting an offer. It is shown that under realistic circumstances, utility formulas currently used could overestimate utility gains by 30%-80%, and that under extreme circumstances, overestimation could be much worse.

Emotions are viewed as represented by information structures in memory, and anxiety is thought to occur when an information structure that serves as program to escape or avoid danger is activated. Emotional processing is defined as the modification of memory structures that underlie emotions. It is argued that some form of exposure to feared situations is common to many psychotherapies for anxiety, and that confrontation with feared objects or situations is an effective treatment. Physiological activation and habituation within and across exposure sessions are cited as indicators of emotional processing, and variables that influence activation and habituation of fear responses are examined. These variables and the indicators are analyzed to yield an account of what information must be integrated for emotional processing of a fear structure. The elements of such a structure are viewed as cognitive representations of the stimulus characteristic of the fear situation, the individual's responses in it, and aspects of its meaning for the individual. Treatment failures are interpreted with respect to the interference of cognitive defenses, autonomic arousal, mood state, and erroneous ideation with reformation of targeted fear structures. Applications of the concepts advanced here to therapeutic practice and to the broader study of psychopathology are discussed. © 1986 American Psychological Association.",,"adaptive behavior; article; behavior therapy; emotion; fear; human; learning; recall; Adaptation, Psychological; Behavior Therapy; Desensitization, Psychologic; Emotions; Fear; Human; Mental Recall; Set (Psychology); Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",,,,,"National Institute of Mental Health, NIMH: R01MH031634",,,,,,,,,,,,"Foa, E.B.; Temple University",,,,,,,,00332909,,PSBUA,"2871574","English","Psychol.

The suggestion treated here is that candidate indices be evaluated by calculating their relative operating characteristics (ROCs). The form of an index's ROC identifies the model of the discrimination process that is implied by the index, and that theoretical form can be compared with the form of empirical ROCs.

Therefore, current concepts and measures of disorder are examined with a historical perspective. It is suggested that the present trend toward nonspecific treatment of disorder provides very limited principles of stress-disorder interaction. Moreover, this approach fails to recognize the effect on this interaction of a heterogeneous array of chronic conditions that exist in nonspecifically indexed disordered groups.

Because causal judgment involves inference and uncertainty, the literature on judgment-under-uncertainty is also considered. Our review is organized around four concepts.

In doing so, we show how these cues can conflict with probabilistic ideas. (c) A model for combining the cues and the causal field allows us to discuss a wide range of studies on causal judgments and explicates methodological issues such as spurious correlation, ""causalation,"" and causal inference in case studies. (d) The discounting of an explanation by specific alternatives is discussed as a special case of the sequential updating of beliefs. Finally, we extend our approach to consider conjunctive explanations in multiple causation. © 1986 American Psychological Association.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Einhorn, H.J.; Graduate School of Business, ",,,,,,,,00332909,,PSBUA,,"English","Psychol.

Furthermore, I summarize how the subjects were selected for the studies, how the problem areas were defined, and what techniques were used to initiate attributional change. As intended, the programs produced changes on the cognitive and behavioral level (i.e., they typically increased the subjects' attributions for failure to lack of effort, and they improved performance as well as persistence). I conclude that reattribution training could become an important aspect of cognitive therapies, and I suggest that its range of convenience can be assessed by applying a variety of attributional changes to a variety of psychological problems.

Research that supported the specificity position examined single instances of behavior or did not properly aggregate behavior over items as well as occasions and was therefore unable to provide evidence for the existence of broad, stable response dispositions, or traits. A detailed examination of four classic studies and of a more recent study by Mischel and Peake (1982), all of which examined multiple items on many occasions, revealed that, in all cases, commitment to a procedural paradigm that emphasized relationships among individual items of behavior resulted either in the use of inappropriate procedures or in the misinterpretation of data. The most common problems concerned inappropriate procedures for item selection and retention, the failure to properly take into account reliability, and, most important, the failure to recognize the importance of attending to relationships among aggregates of items.

Functional theories propose that the formation and transformation of mental images contribute to object recognition and comparison. Interactive theories propose that imagery contributes directly to ongoing perceptual processes. The evidence for each type of theory is critically evaluated in view of the following alternative accounts: task-induced demand characteristics, experimenter bias, tacit knowledge, and eye movements. Efforts to rule out these alternatives have had varying degrees of success, with the consequence that the three types of imagery theories differ in the extent to which they have been confirmed. © 1985 American Psychological Association.",,"association; color vision; depth perception; eye movement; human; imagination; memory; perception; physiology; psychological theory; review; rotation; suggestion; vision; visual field; visual illusion; Association; Color Perception; Eye Movements; Figural Aftereffect; Human; Imagination; Memory; Optical Illusions; Perception; Psychological Theory; Rotation; Space Perception; Suggestion; Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.; Visual Fields; Visual Perception",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Finke, R.A.; Department of Psychology, , Brook",,,,,,,,00332909,,PSBUA,"3901061","English","Psychol.

The review of studies is organized according to (a) whether a measure assesses support structure or function, and (b) the degree of specificity (vs. globality) of the scale. By structure we mean simply the existence of relationships, and by function we mean the extent to which one's interpersonal relationships provide particular resources. Special attention is paid to methodological characteristics that are requisite for a fair comparison of the models. The review concludes that there is evidence consistent with both models. Evidence for a buffering model is found when the social support measure assesses the perceived availability of interpersonal resources that are responsive to the needs elicited by stressful events. Evidence for a main effect model is found when the support measure assesses a person's degree of integration in a large social network. Both conceptualizations of social support are correct in some respects, but each represents a different process through which social support may affect well-being. Implications of these conclusions for theories of social support processes and for the design of preventive interventions are discussed. © 1985 American Psychological Association.",,"adult; depression; emotional disorder; employment; family; female; health; human; life event; male; mental stress; model; occupational disease; psychological aspect; review; self concept; sex difference; social environment; social support; Affective Symptoms; Depressive Disorder; Employment; Family; Female; Health; Human; Life Change Events; Male; Middle Age; Models, Psychological; Occupational Diseases; Self Concept; Sex Factors; Social Environment; Social Support; Stress, Psychological; Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.; Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",,,,,"National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, NHLBI: R01HL021891; National Cancer Institute, NCI: R01CA038243",,,,,,,,,,,,"Cohen, S.; Department of Psychology, ",,,,,,,,00332909,,PSBUA,"3901065","English","Psychol.

After examining a number of studies of perceptual economy, we embark on a systematic analysis of this notion. We examine the notion that simple perceptual representations must be defined within the ""geometric constraints"" provided by proximal stimulation. We then take up metrics of simplicity. Any study of perceptual economy must use a metric of simplicity; the choice of metric may be seen as a matter of convention, or it may have deep theoretical and empirical implications.

This review identifies the major empirical assumptions underlying Kohlberg's claim for cross-cultural universality, including culturally diverse samplings, universal moral questions, invariant stage sequence, full range of stages, and general applicability of the stages. It then reviews the cross-cultural research literature, much of which has not been previously published, and evaluates the support for each assumption. In addition to providing striking support for the underlying assumptions, the 45 studies examined here also identify some major caveats regarding the range and general applicability of the stages across cultures. In particular, biases in favor of complex urban societies and middle-class populations are identified.

In the present article, Murch's conception is evaluated by comparing the basic characteristics of conditioning with those of MEs. Although some similarities are noted, MEs differ from CRs in that they fail to display relative permanence, be disrupted by reduction of the correlation between the CS and UCS during acquisition, and show accumulative effects of practice. It is concluded that MEs are not classically conditioned responses; the question of whether they can be regarded as any form of learned behavior is debated.

Recent findings in the neuroanatomy and physiology of the visual system and cerebral structures suggest that the brain is an interactive system whose 2 hemispheres participate conjointly in the production of behavior and that damage in one component inevitably affects other components. The implications of these properties for research on unilaterally brain-damaged patients are outlined, and empirical evidence of sensory impairments following extrastriate lesion is presented. It is suggested that the effects of such lesions on the neural descriptions of a visual stimulus is to produce deprivation of some aspects of the incoming information, particularly those on which the left hemisphere normally operates. The visuospatial competence of the left hemisphere may not be displayed in such conditions because the representations of the visual world, as elaborated in a damaged brain, are not compatible with its specific neural sensitivity, although the right hemisphere can accommodate itself to such representations. An examination of relevant findings from the normal population indicates that the critical contribution of the right hemisphere to visual pattern recognition prevails under conditions of substantial functional sensory deficits resulting from the particular viewing conditions inherent in lateral tachistoscopic presentations.

However, predictable conditions may be more stressful than unpredictable conditions when sessions are long and extend over days and when parameters of stress are less severe.

Methodological problems are identified and discussed. In particular, it is noted that all of the follow-up studies failed to use psychiatric controls; this makes it difficult to draw conclusions about the diagnostic validity of the concept of hyperactivity. Four of the follow-back studies did use psychiatric controls, but conclusions are limited by the atypical nature of their S groups.

Although this approach has much in common with a stimulus generalization decrement interpretation of performance change, little attention has been paid to data from stimulus control research showing that generalization gradients typically flatten over time. A literature review indicates that loss of stimulus control with delayed testing occurs for background contexts as well as for conditioned or discriminative stimuli and supports the interpretation that stimulus attributes are forgotten. These findings pose a paradox: The functionally increased interchangeability of stimuli after a retention interval makes it unlikely that disruption of memory can be attributed to subtle shifts in context under the nominally identical conditions of a retention test.

Throughout learning's experimental history, psychologists have asked where movement segments come from and how they are organized into more complex movement sequences. From the beginning, animal psychologists have asked the extent to which movement segments and their organization into sequences is instinctive. For decades the response-chaining hypothesis has been the explanation of how segments are organized by learning; however, modern research does not support it and has tilted the explanation toward a cognitive interpretation. A parallel account of how humans learn movement sequences is presented. The positions of Piaget (1952) and J. S. Bruner (1973) from developmental psychology, as well as those of K. S. Lashley (1951) and more recent analysts of movement regulation, are reviewed. Here, too, cognitive interpretations prevail.

The neurophysiological effect of amphetamine and methylphenidate in animals is to facilitate the action of dopamine and norepinephrine by blocking reuptake from the synapse, inhibiting the action of MAO, and facilitating release of catecholamines. One hypothesis emerging from an integration of these findings is that decreased activity and increased ability to focus attention following stimulant drug administration are analogous to the increased constriction and stereotypy observed in animal studies. It is suggested that children who become more hyperactive on a given dose of stimulant may improve at higher doses and that injection of dopamine into striatal nuclei would reproduce the beneficial effects of amphetamine.

A theoretical case for the effectiveness of distraction is drawn from assumptions about the importance of cognition in mediating the pain experience and the limited capacity available for focusing attention on different stimulus events. Combining these assumptions led to 4 principles that were examined with available data. Principle 1 holds that distractions will reduce stress as compared with uninstructed and placebo control conditions. Principle 2 maintains that distraction techniques that require more attentional capacity will be more effective. Principle 3 contends that distraction will have stronger effects on pain stimuli of low intensity. Principle 4 predicts that distraction will be more effective than sensation redefinition for mild pain stimuli, but the reverse will be true for intense pain stimuli. Data support these principles. Research is needed to compare distraction and expectancy control conditions, to test distraction for clinical as opposed to acute pain, to compare distraction strategies that vary in quantified attentional requirements, and to discover the features of pain stimuli.

KR is defined as augmented feedback, where the KR is additional to those sources of feedback that are naturally received when a response is made. Transfer tests, usually under no-KR conditions, are essential for unraveling the temporary effects of KR manipulations from their relatively permanent learning effects. When this is considered, the literature reveals findings that produce reasonable agreement, although there are a number of inconsistencies in studies examining the same variables. When learning vs performance effects of KR are separated, a number of contradictions occur; new principles that emerge include the notion that KR acts as guidance, that it is motivating or energizing, and that it has a role in the formation of associations. It is suggested that KR may guide an S to the proper target behavior, with other processes (e.g., simple repetition) being the critical determinants of learning.

A particular variant of this theory is that language deficits, which are assumed to be attributable to left-hemisphere dysfunction, constitute the core deficit of the syndrome. The structure of these arguments and the empirical evidence are critically reviewed. It is concluded that the left-hemisphere hypothesis is inadequate to account for many of the cardinal features of autism, that it is based to some extent on flawed reasoning and weak evidence, and that it overestimates the importance of linguistic dysfunction in autistic children. Some of the questionable assumptions of this hypothesis include the following: (1) Language is always selectively impaired in autism; and (2) language reflects left hemisphere function. Nonlanguage evidence for left-hemisphere dysfunction is reviewed. Several alternative hypotheses are proposed to explain the possible link between left-hemisphere signs and infantile autism.

Judgment is conceptualized as consisting of 3 components: information valuation, information integration, and translation of impressions into overt responses. It is important to distinguish between developmental changes that occur in different components of the judgment process. Most developmental studies have assumed that rating scales are used in an equal-interval manner, with few attempts to test that assumption. The conditions allowing a conclusion that individuals or groups differ in information integration are outlined, and methods of testing models of the information integration process that do not assume an equal-interval response scale are reviewed. Although these methods require more complicated experimental designs, their benefits in identifying the possible loci of developmental changes in judgments outweigh their inconvenience. The major advantage of mathematical models of judgment is that they can provide precise theoretical descriptions of either development changes or individual differences in the way information is combined, a fundamental issue in the study of cognition.

In contrast to the myriad of anecdotal reports extolling the virtues of hypnosis for this purpose, controlled laboratory studies have consistently failed to demonstrate any hypnotic memory improvement. Although the relevancy of these laboratory studies may be questioned because they used verbal, frequently nonmeaningful stimuli in a low arousal environment, several recent studies that have used more forensically relevant, arousal-provoking stimuli persist in showing no hypnosis advantage. Since there is no clear documentation that hypnosis can improve memory, and since the courts have become increasingly reluctant to accept the testimony of witnesses who have undergone hypnosis because of the problem of suggestibility, several nonhypnotic procedures of memory enhancement are considered.

This advantage was sufficient to place the average SSM-treated S at a level of therapeutic outcome comparable to the 77th percentile of controls.

The 2nd, predicated on the notion of category-feature collocation, appears to be an appropriate measure of intercategory differentiation. Cue validity is defined as the probability with which the possessor of a given feature is a member of a particular category. The collocation measure, on the other hand, represents (in the present context) the product of cue validity and a 2nd factor. This 2nd factor is the converse of cue validity: the probability with which a member of a given category possesses a particular feature.

The abnormalities are nonspecific and can result from a variety of causes. Preliminary evidence suggests that there are 2 or more syndromes that differ in severity and type of brain abnormality, rather than a unitary schizophrenic illness. A complex, variable picture of brain dysfunction, including ventricular enlargement and cerebral atrophy, disturbances of cerebral metabolism, neuropsychologic deficits, and neurologic ""soft"" signs, is found especially in chronically impaired schizophrenics with ""negative"" symptoms. Extent and locus of dysfunction in a corticosubcortical arousal/attention system involving areas of the frontal cortex, limbic system, and brain-stem reticular formation are hypothesized to determine the relative prominence of positive and negative symptoms. Future research on neuroanatomy, etiology, and treatment must consider the heterogeneity of the schizophrenias and might utilize the positive/negative dimension.

Schachter and J. Singer's (1962) cognition-arousal theory of emotion are clarified, and empirical evidence pertaining to 3 major deductions from the theory is reviewed. It is concluded that only 1 of these deductions, claiming that misattributed arousal from an extraneous source intensifies emotional reactions, is adequately supported by the data. Little support is found for the 2nd hypothesis, that arousal reduction leads to a reduction in the intensity of emotional state. The status of the 3rd hypothesis, that misattribution of emotionally induced arousal to a neutral source results in a reduction of emotionality, is considered equivocal because of plausible alternative interpretations of the pertinent findings. There is no convincing evidence for Schachter and Singer's claim that arousal is a necessary condition for an emotional state, nor for the suggestion that emotional states may result from a labeling of unexplained arousal. It is suggested that the role of arousal in emotion has been overstated and that the available data support at best a rather attenuated version of Schachter's theory--that arousal feedback can have an intensifying effect on emotional states--and that this arousal-emotion relationship is mediated, in part, by causal attributions regarding the source of arousal.

The usual procedure has been to express this component as a difference between 2 times that can be directly measured. But correlations involving difference scores are notably attenuated by the presence of measurement error, and the substantive assumptions implicit in the calculation of difference scores may not be plausible. The recommended approach begins with reasonable statements of how components of processes are structured in confirmatory factor analysis models, which can be estimated by LISREL or COFAMM. In the process of fitting such models, the proper disattenuated correlation is estimated as part of a set of parameters implied by substantive assumptions. The validity of these assumptions can be tested by comparing the fit of the model to observed data. Such a comparison may suggest how assumptions should be modified to increase the plausibility of the model. This model-fitting approach is illustrated with data relating information-processing tasks to ability measures.

The principle of aggregation states that the sum of a set of multiple measurements is a more stable and representative estimator than any single measurement. This greater representation occurs because there is inevitably some error associated with measurement. By combining numerous exemplars, such errors of measurement are averaged out, leaving a clearer view of underlying relationships. The usefulness of this principle is illustrated in 12 major areas of developmental research in which the issue of negligible correlations figures prominently: (a) the validity of judges' ratings, (b) the cross-situational consistency of moral character and personality, (c) the longitudinal stability of personality, (d) the coherence of stages of cognitive development, (e) metacognition, (f) the attitude-behavior relationship, (g) the personality-behavior relationship, (h) the role-taking/altruism relationship, (i) the moral-judgment/altruism relationship, (j) the legitimacy of the construct of attachment, (k) the existence of sex differences, and (l) the assessment of emotionality in animals.

A review of empirical evidence on the effects of family configuration factors on intellectual performance scores reveals a consistent pattern of results supporting the assumptions and predictions of the confluence model. With one exception, all studies show performance scores to decline with family size for sibships larger than one. The pattern of these effects remains the same even when SES is held constant. As predicted by the confluence model, birth order effects are found to be age dependent, with children younger than 13 yrs showing no birth order effects.

When the effect-magnitude parameters (correlation coefficients or standardized mean differences) are heterogeneous across studies, it is often desirable to cluster studies into groups that are homogeneous with respect to the effect-size parameter. The present paper presents 2 procedures for clustering correlation coefficients and standardized mean differences when each estimator is based on the same number of observations. One procedure yields disjoint clusters and the other yields possibly overlapping clusters. In each case a method for determining the statistical significance level of the clusterings is given.

Recent failures to find such a correspondence have caused the X-linked hypothesis to fall into disfavor. There are serious and apparently unrecognized problems associated with this strategy because there is no conceptual justification for it. A 4-component bivariate mixture model is proposed as a framework within which to view familial sample correlation coefficients. The expected values of the sample correlation coefficients under the model reflect other influences such as environmental determinants, not X-linked effects, even if the X-linked influences are substantial.

Sternberg's (1969) additive factor method is generally accepted by experimental psychologists as a decisive method for the decomposition of the RT process into stages. It is presented as an alternative for F. C. Donder's (1868) subtraction method and the structuralist or model approach. The present paper demonstrates the theoretical differences between the functionalist or Sternbergian approach to RT and the structuralist or model approach. The 2 approaches are evaluated relative to their fertility in contributing to the understanding of the processes involved in human information processing and the systematic cumulation of knowledge regarding these processes. Problems related to the assumptions used in the additive factor method are discussed. It is shown that the relation between the mean RT for 1 S and the mean RT over Ss, which is generally used as the dependent variable in the analysis of variance, depends on the specific distribution of RTs within the stages. It is pointed out that the interpretation of factor effects resulting from ANOVA is not clear. In addition, it is shown that the additive factor method cannot be used to identify or estimate the number of stages in the RT process.

The basic features of tachistoscopic experiments are analyzed with a special emphasis on methodology. Variables determining the quality of the input are investigated as a function of the properties of the human visual system. Exposure duration, luminance, retinal eccentricity, and stimulus size all contribute to the efficiency of the hemispheres and interact in complex ways in the emergence of visual-field superiorities. Task demands are also examined in terms of the information necessary for efficient processing.

The present paper examines 2 issues regarding the use of ICCs: (a) the real vs theoretical limits of ICCs and procedures for applying significance tests when using these measures and (b) sources of unreliability in the data. The real limits of some ICCs are not 0 and +1.00 (the theoretical limits), but exceed both -2.00 and +1.00. Even when within the theoretical limits, the ICC values may not always reflect the reliability of the measure. Under certain conditions, one can obtain moderately high ICC values that are not significantly different from zero, suggesting that researchers calculate the significance of the target variance before calculating the intraclass r. Three sources of unreliability are also identified: patterns of both positive and negative correlations among judges, limited variance in the data matrix, and no correlations among judges. A method of determining the significance of the Judge × Target interaction and for demonstrating how that procedure can be used to aid in the identification of sources of unreliability, is detailed.

The present authors applied Lewis and Griffin's method in analyzing the birth-month distribution of 11,728 schizophrenic patients first admitted to hospitals in England and Wales between 1970 and 1974. Even when thus corrected, the birth distribution of the schizophrenics remained significantly different from that of the controls. In addition, when July was taken as the 1st mo of the year, the predictions of their hypothesis were not confirmed.

Opinions differ greatly on the relation of these effects to sex. The empirical evidence reviewed covers investigations of all major manifestations of normal and pathological grief: psychological distress and depression, mental illness, physical illness, mortality, and suicide. Evidence from both cross-sectional and longitudinal studies is considered.

This selective noticing is the province of central mechanisms of orientation and attention that are represented in structures along the neuraxis from brain stem to neocortex. One of the structures is the frontal eye field, long known to be implicated in visual attention through its involvement in horizontal movements of the eyes. The author reviews the relevant neuroanatomy and behavioral and electrophysiological research that decisively show that this small but complex region does more than regulate eye movements. Theories of frontal eye field function are considered, concluding with 2 contemporary views of attention, one based on arousal and the other on the processes of representation of stimulus input, that offer special promise for understanding the role of frontal cortex in the direction of attention.

To attribute this change to skewness alone is incorrect. Many distinctions are pertinent to the choice of whether to use such transformations: informal data analysis vs formal inference on experiments based on strong theory, the size of the error term relative to the size of the treatment effects, considerations of interactions, simplicity of results, and statistical assumptions.

The present author presents a random effects model (analogous to random effects ANOVA) in which the population effect sizes are not fixed but are sample realizations from a distribution of possible population effect sizes. An analogy to variance component estimation is used to derive an unbiased estimator of the variance of the effect-size distribution. An example shows that these methods may suggest insights that are not available from inspection of means and standard deviation of effect-size estimates.

Capacity theory is proposed as an alternative theoretical framework within which the various phenotypically diverse attentional deficits in schizophrenia reflect a deficit in the control function that governs the mobilization and allocation of attention. Attentional deficits, therefore, are most manifest when effortful processing in short-term storage is required. Research on short-term memory processes in schizophrenics shows that the magnitude of the attention deficit correlates positively with the attentional requirements of the cognitive operations involved. The dysfunction is thought to reflect the high levels of arousal characteristic of schizophrenics. Parallels in the performance of schizophrenics and essentially normal but hyperaroused Ss are outlined in support of this hypothesis. The failure to consider the possible mediating effects of hyperarousal in attentional performance of schizophrenics is an omission in the research on schizophrenic cognition.

The SC function describes a general goal of exercising influence to change the behavior of others. Specifically, that process is designed to produce reactions not likely in the absence of such influence. Patterns of nonverbal involvement in the service of the SC function are reviewed in the areas of status, power, and dominance; persuasion; feedback/reinforcement; deception; and impression management. The role of these patterns in the employment interview and counseling situation is addressed. In contrast to the common assumption that nonverbal behavior usually reflects a spontaneous and consistent affective reaction, this research strongly suggests that in many instances nonverbal behavior may be managed to influence the behavior of others.

The authors propose the use of a recently developed econometric technique that can correct for restriction of range attributable to both measured and unmeasured variables.

Based on well-established distribution theory and the assumption that the error terms in the 2 equations are distributed bivariate normal, the technique enables the researcher to estimate the bias associated with using the restricted sample.

Recent data indicate that the exposure orientation may have outlived its usefulness because it implies that addiction is interminable since each dose strengthens the habit. The strongest evidence against the exposure view has come from the low rate of Vietnam veterans who relapsed into addiction after detoxification. The authors recommend a major shift of emphasis toward the adaptive orientation, which would benefit science, psychotherapy, and public policy. However, they also discuss 4 problems of the adaptive orientation (and their resolutions): explanation of the self-destructive nature of addiction; the plethora of retrospective, rather than experimental, evidence; the hesitancy of psychologists to reject the long-standing exposure hypothesis; and the lack of large-scale success in using this psychotherapeutic view to cure addicts.

Research has found that responses to these questionnaires are reliable but that they correspond only moderately with a person's memory performance. Apparently, people's beliefs about their memory performance are stable but not accurate. Research also has found that responses to memory questionnaires vary with several variables: the kind of memory failure, susceptibility to cognitive failures under stress, confidence in memory performance, and age of Ss. Thus, although memory questionnaires are only moderately successful indicators of memory performance, they may nevertheless elucidate the properties of beliefs that underlie performance.

This article addresses the common situation in which data analysis is exploratory rather than hypothesis testing and in which the model is applied to data that only loosely meet the requirements of the design. In this case, aging, period, or cohort effects can be inferred if the researcher is willing to make appropriate restrictive assumptions and use scientific judgment rather than fixed decision rules.

For example, the relationship is strong for single women but rarely observed for married women in general; it is more likely to be found in working-class than in middle-class samples.

The notion has also directed attention to the multiplicity of changes that may follow treatment. Recently, research has demonstrated that for a given individual several behaviors tend to be correlated to form clusters of responses. Therapeutic changes in one response in a particular cluster are likely to affect other, related responses. The concomitant changes associated with treatment of a particular problem may be both positive and negative, depending on the behaviors that ordinarily covary with the target problem. Response covariation, as an empirical alternative to symptom substitution, has important implications for therapy outcome research and clinical treatment. The present article reviews evidence for response covariation in the context of treatment. An interactional model of personality is outlined to examine the possible bases for the development of response covariation and to provide an assessment strategy for systematically evaluating the organization of behavior. Implications of response covariation and an interactional assessment approach for evaluating treatment are discussed.

Drawing on concepts used in decision-making, achievement, and attribution research, this psychological model links academic choice to expectations of success and the subjective value of a particular course. In addition, the model specifies the relations among a set of other variables that are believed to mediate individual differences in both students' expectations of success and their perceptions of the relative value of various academic options. The utility of the model for increasing understanding of course enrollment patterns and career decisions and for designing appropriate intervention strategies is discussed.

Several approaches to measuring compensation are examined, and it is shown that none provides an assessment of compensation in its complete sense. These approaches either assess logical multiplication, a component of compensation, or they permit a test of the hypothesis that the performance is consistent with a compensation mechanism. Notwithstanding these limitations, developmental studies support the conclusion that the ability to conserve can be attained without the ability to compensate. Further, conservation training research points to the same conclusion. Nevertheless, the compensation principle appears to become incorporated into the adult's conservation concept and comes to play an important role in how transformations are judged.

While anger and hostility are found to be correlated with hypertension, the mechanism is not yet clearly specified. A global portrait drawn from the literature would depict the hypertensive as a conflicted individual ridden with hostility and resentment, constantly guarding against impulse expression through distancing, suppression, submission, and/or compliance. In the heart disease literature, aggression is more commonly referred to than anger; recent evidence suggests, however, that hostility may be a highly significant component of the Type A coronary-prone behavior pattern. In contrast to hypertensives, coronary-prone individuals seem to be more aggressive, prone to channel emotional arousal into action, and less anxious when provoked.

For the divorced family, 6 classes of variables (e.g., parent-child relationships, interparental relationships, and mechanics of alternations) are discussed. For the social system, attention is given to the potential effect of formal social institutions (work settings, schools, and the legal system) and of informal social networks (kin and friends) on the postdivorce interrelationships of parents and children. The importance of examining the effects of custody arrangements in terms of a family life cycle is emphasized.

The evidence is consistent with a model in which spatial or temporal judgments in context are a weighted average of the given interval, temporal or spatial, and the expected time or distance that would be traversed at a given velocity.

An examination of interacting variables found that, consistent with K. G. Shaver's (see PA, Vol 44:6696 and 44:14405) defensive-attribution hypothesis, when observers were personally and situationally similar to the accident perpetrator, they tended to attribute less responsibility to the perpetrator when accident severity increased.

Experiments using stronger S-involving manipulations also appeared more likely to produce evidence in support of the defensive-attribution hypothesis than did experiments with low-involvement manipulations.

This coincidence may imply that different cognitive processes are required for achieving reading proficiency in different writing systems. The studies reviewed include experiments on visual scanning and lateralization, perceptual demands, word recognition, speech recoding, and sentence comprehension. Results indicate that human visual information processing is indeed affected by orthographic variation but only at the lower levels (data-driven or bottom-up processes). With respect to higher-level processing (concept-driven or top-down processes), reading behavior seems to be immune to orthographic variations. Further analyses of segmentation in script as well as in speech revealed that every orthography transcribes sentences at the level of words and that the transcription is achieved in a morphemic way.

In particular, whereas judgment is part of a continuous, interactive process that people use to cope with the environment, most judgment research has focused on discrete incidents. This has led to underestimating the importance of feedback in ongoing processes and the unquestioned acceptance of several assumptions implicit in the discrete, normative models used to evaluate judgmental performance. In the present paper, these issues are elaborated in considering the distinctions between discrete and continuous approaches to the study of judgment and choice. It is argued that several biases identified in discrete incidents result from heuristics that are functional in the more natural continuous environment. Thus, a discrete-continuous perspective is necessary in evaluating judgmental heuristics. Questions are raised concerning both the meaning and applicability of discrete, normative theories of judgment and choice.

Prominent sources of this ubiquitous effect are the true intercorrelation of categories and the illusory theories that raters hold about the extent to which categories covary. Cognitive distortions that increase the survival of illusory covariance theories are identified, including failure to adequately attend to hit rates, the differential ease of making ""same"" or ""similar"" vs ""different"" judgments, confirmatory bias in hypothesis testing, and the discounting of impression-inconsistent information. Nine methods (e.g., rating irrelevant categories) currently used to reduce illusory halo are reviewed, and it is concluded that increasing the sample of the ratees' current behavior is the most effective method in use. However, all methods probably leave residual illusory halo. A model of the rating process is described that attempts to direct research toward increasing understanding of the observation, encoding, storage, retrieval, and evaluation sequence, and to illuminate the paradoxical low positive correlation between halo and accuracy reported in 4 recent studies.

In the present article, the normative, or statistically correct, model for making covariation judgments is outlined in detail. Six steps of the normative model, from deciding what data are relevant to the judgment to using the judgment as a basis for predictions and decisions, are specified. Potential sources of error in social perceivers' covariation judgments are identified at each step, and research on social perceivers' ability to follow each step in the normative model is reviewed. It is concluded that statistically naive individuals have a tenuous grasp of the concept of covariation, and circumstances under which covariation judgments tend to be accurate or inaccurate are considered.

Exacerbation of tumor growth is evident following acute exposure to uncontrollable but not controllable stress, and the effects of aversive stimuli vary as a function of prior stress history and social housing conditions. The fact that stress influences neurochemical, hormonal, and immunological functioning and that these changes are subject to many of the same manipulations that influenced the carcinogenic process suggests a relation between these 3 mechanisms and the stress-induced alterations of tumor growth. This contention is supported by findings showing that pharmacological manipulations that modify these endogenous substrates have predictable effects on tumorigenesis.

P300 does not appear to be a real-time index of signal (target) selection, since attended low-probability nonsignals also result in P300 and its latency is too long. P300 further appears to be independent of response selection; its latency therefore may or may not correlate with RT, depending on the experimental context.

P300 amplitude appears sensitive to manipulations of perceptual limited capacity but not sensitive to manipulations of motor limited capacity.

The present critical review begins with a working definition of captivity (constraint, segregation, protection, taming, and dependency) and moves to problems in measuring its behavioral effects. Many problems are based on indifference and misunderstanding. Ethologists have traditionally supposed the effects of captivity to be distorting, psychologists have supposed them innocuous or helpful, and zoo keepers and others have dramatized them as aberrant. Although uncommon, actual research on captivity suggests that many behaviors generalize well across laboratory and wild situations. Methods of systematic analysis of captivity are suggested. Feralization, the study of captive and domestic animals returned to wild conditions, is demonstrated in 2 experiments that assessed cage vs burrow raising and litter size as an agent of feralization in rats; such studies are seen as a convenient and productive means of studying the behavioral effects of captivity.

Trabasso et al (1975, 1977) regarding Piaget's theory of transitive inference ability. Trabasso claims to have demonstrated that the conceptual understanding underlying transitive reasoning does not develop with age, as Piaget claimed, but can be found among Ss as young as 4 yrs of age if language comprehension and memory are controlled. In reply, the difficulty of distinguishing between the understanding of lower and higher level Ss on the basis of average performance over many trials is discussed. Instead of analyzing data from the early and later trials of the task, it is suggested that Ss' behavior be analyzed as it evolves during the tasks to assess the concepts with which Ss approach them.

Rank-order correlations between these 2 variables were upwards of .7 for both SAT-Verbal (SAT-V) and SAT-Mathematics (SAT-M) scales. The relationship was nonlinear with arithmetically increasing amounts of score effect associated with geometrically increasing amounts of student contact time. Thus, diminishing returns in SAT coaching effects, especially for SAT-V, were found. According to the logarithmic models' fit to the data, the student contact time required to achieve average score increases of more than 20-30 points (on a 200-800 point scale) for both SAT-V and SAT-M rapidly approaches that of full-time schooling.

Abelson (see record 1973-04425-001), used the ""arc sine transform."" Method 1, as suspected, performed most poorly under conditions (small N, large or small p) in which the binomial departed markedly from the normal. However, the statistic performed better than generally expected and could be used safely with small to moderate samples. Method 2 was found to be seriously biased, essentially because a nonlinear transform was applied to a linear hypothesis. Moreover, even when conditions were optimal for its use, Method 2 failed to outperform the more traditional test. It is argued that the use of Method 2 should be discontinued.

To support this claim, the widely discrepant evidence concerning the effect of target energy on IM is reanalyzed in light of relative strengths and weaknesses of the various methodologies used. It is shown that the results obtained from a particular procedure, identified as especially sensitive to alternate interpretations, are consistently at odds with those obtained from theoretically purer iconic tasks.

Behavioral augmentations frequently observed following repeated drug treatment are postulated to reflect alterations in DA activity, whereas the reduction of the drug's effect is ascribed to changes in attentional processes owing to variations in NE activity.

Despite methodological problems related to the assessment of both delinquent conduct and moral judgment, discernible trends in the data have begun to emerge. Perhaps most significant is that delinquency only moderately relates to a premoral ideological orientation. Although reliable differences between delinquent and nondelinquent youths in moral reasoning have not been demonstrated, moral judgment stage appears to covary with personality and behavioral characteristics of the delinquents themselves. Evidence also suggests that their level of moral judgment is significantly influenced by a variety of situational, motivational, and attitudinal variables. In light of these results, distinctions are drawn (following J. Flavell in T. Mischel, 1974) between underlying sociomoral capabilities and the tendency to exercise and apply these capabilities.

It is also noted that the decision to guard one type of error more than the other is subjective and not mathematical. Psychological researchers should consider setting the overall rate of Type I errors at a value significantly larger than .05 for certain types of investigations.

Peripheral integrative masking is said to occur when masking is energy dependent, by analogy with photographic emulsions. Central interruptive masking is said to occur when masking is time dependent, by analogy with digital computers. Psychophysical studies have tested a variety of other properties of the integrative-interruptive dichotomy beyond time vs energy dependence; these tests have generally supported the integrative interpretation. Psychobiological studies have shown that neural integration can produce time-dependent effects in a masking paradigm. Data lead to this harmonization of the masking problem: Different features (sensory codes) of identical neural responses differ in their energy or time dependence. Since the sensory code is task dependent, task variation can cause a single integrative mechanism to lead to either time or energy dependent behavior. Thus, the variety and complexity of the behaviors in masking studies are a joint consequence of the variety of sensory codes and the complexity of neural integration.

In at least 1 of these analyses, the tested Ss varied widely in age and education and other conditions that are likely to bias intercorrelations of test scores. The 2 obtained factors purported to represent gf and gc could thus have been spurious. In other analyses with better controls, however, 2 such factors did also appear, with 2 or 3 in addition.

In the present article, these indices are analyzed and reformulated in terms of agreement statistics based on all pairs of raters. It has been argued that simultaneous agreement among all raters could provide an alternative basis for measuring multiple-rater agreement; however, agreement among raters can actually be considered to be an arbitrary choice along a continuum ranging from agreement for a pair of raters to agreement among all raters. Using this generalized concept of g-wise agreement, multiple-rater kappas are extended, interrelated, and illustrated.

J. E. Overall and J. A. Woodward's (see record 1975-08623-001) ""paradox"" that power increases as reliability of difference decreases is shown to result from 2 confusions: that of variance ratio with the property of reliability of a measuring procedure and that of indirect with direct relationship. The inverse relationship between magnitudes of variance ratio and power that holds for the conditions set by Overall and Woodward is actually an indirect consequence of variation that by stipulation is not variation in reliability as such. The paradoxical relationship is spurious. At the same time, as J. L. Fleiss (1976) argued, unreliability proper diminishes power. Thus the paradox is resolved. Although it is typically impractical to vary either true or error variance, an experimenter can offset the detrimental effects of unreliability of measurement on power by averaging, after collecting more than 1 observation per S per treatment.

If a monotonic rescaling of the dependent measure can eliminate the interaction effect, then one must question the psychological importance of the effect. Two methods have been developed that can test whether a significant interaction is present for all monotonic scale transformations. Before these methods (functional measurement and conjoint measurement) can be evaluated, it is necessary to (a) formalize the conceptual model being tested in these situations, (b) identify the type of error theory assumed by the statistical test, and (c) consider the type of experimental design used.

Interventions that increase personal control and/or stressor predictability are effective in reducing poststressor effects. There is also evidence for poststimulation effects on social behavior which generally involve an insensitivity toward others following stressor exposure. Studies of exposure to environmental stressors in naturalistic settings report effects similar to those found in laboratory settings.

Recent findings indicate that there are a number of physiological similarities between borderline hypertension and the blood pressure changes that occur during laboratory stress. Behavioral factors may play a role in established hypertension through their impact on baroreceptor activity, blood volume adjustments, or sodium retention. In general, attempts to link hypertension with environmental events and personality have not added greatly to knowledge about hypertension. However, findings suggest that the Type A coronary-prone behavior pattern is related to blood pressure levels, and there is some evidence that personality variables may be related to blood pressure levels in certain physiological subtypes of essential hypertensives.

However, several schools of behaviorism that are committed to an intersubjective agreement criterion of truth have nevertheless included private events in their theories. RB has also rejected truth criteria based on incorrigibility, either of immediate experience or of scientific observation. Instead, according to one interpretation, RB has adopted a version of the correspondence theory of truth, and, according to another preferred interpretation, RB has adopted a pragmatic theory of truth. However, various problems arise in applying these criteria. These problems may be resolved by interpreting the criterion of truth that is generated by a science of behavior as logically analogous to the set of ethical values that is generated by that science.

Since the statistical procedures are fairly new, little is known about the operating characteristics of the hypothesis tests in terms of Type I and Type II error rates. The present report provides some basic information on the characteristics of the testing procedures with respect to 7 factors: effects of small sample size, power estimation, test nonorthogonality, alternative chi-square statistics, conditional chi-square tests, collapsing across categories, and collapsing across variables. Monte Carlo simulation results and asymptotic theory suggest that the hypothesis testing procedures based on the log-linear model do possess reasonable operating characteristics; however, care must be taken to ensure that the tests are applied and interpreted appropriately.

Valid applications of both tests are conducted on sets of orthogonal normalized variables that are associated with each cluster of within-S mean square ratios.

Sources of variation in performance on spatial tests including environmental, genetic, hormonal, and neurological are considered, with special emphasis on age and sex differences. Evidence that variation in spatial test scores is to some degree heritable remains positive; however, the X-linked recessive gene hypothesis that has served as a tentative explanation for sex differences in spatial abilities and for the mode of genetic transmission is not supported strongly in recent studies. Neurological studies showing variations in the lateral organization of the human brain provide experimental evidence for a structural source of the variation in spatial abilities, and this evidence is reviewed as it relates to human handedness and cerebral bilateralization for spatial and linguistic functions.

Simple memories for events are apparently formed quickly and are permanent. In such cases, an initial physiologically unstable period is not required. Thus, most forgetting is the result of a retrieval failure rather than a storage failure. A distinction between active memory (AM) and inactive memory (IM) is made. AM is a subset of IM and contains either newly formed memories or established retrieved memories or both. Implications for psychobiology of the AM and IM distinction are discussed. It is suggested, for example, that while in AM, memories are particularly open to disruption either by amnesic agents or through other forms of interference. The forgetting process for new and established memories is time dependent (but independent of memory age) and is based on interference. It is desirable to maintain the distinction between memory storage and memory retrieval even while recognizing that associative storage aids in retrieval. The search for the biological basis of rapidly forming memories, perhaps based on the restructuring of protein fragments, remains important, but the physiological brain processes underlying memory interference and retrieval require greater emphasis.

There is great variation among the studies in sample composition, definition of variables, method of data collection, and the ages and intervals studied. Generally, the size of a (disattenuated) stability coefficient tends to decrease linearly as the interval between the 2 times of measurement (T2--iT1) increases. Furthermore, the degree of stability can be broadly described as a positive linear function of the interval covered and the S's age at the time of first measurement, expressed in the age ratio T1/T2. The degree of stability that exists in the area of aggression was found to be quite substantial; it was, in fact, not much lower than the stability typically found in the domain of intelligence testing. Marked individual differences in habitual aggression level manifest themselves early in life, certainly by the age of 3. It is generally concluded that (a) the degree of longitudinal consistency in aggressive behavior patterns is much greater than has been maintained by proponents of a behavioral specificity position, and (b) important determinants of the observed longitudinal consistency are to be found in relatively stable, individual-differentiating reaction tendencies or motive systems (personality variables) within individuals.

This ""similar sequence hypothesis"" holds that retarded and nonretarded persons traverse the same stages of cognitive development in the same order, differing only in the rate at which they progress and in the ultimate developmental ceiling they attain. Current evidence relevant to this hypothesis is drawn from 3 longitudinal and 28 cross-sectional studies of developmental phenomena described by Piaget. The great preponderance of this evidence supports the hypothesis with respect to every subject group, with the possible exception of individuals suffering from pronounced EEG abnormalities. The quality of current evidence is critically evaluated, and procedures by which more precise tests of the hypothesis might be fashioned are proposed. Overall, the review illustrates that developmental research with atypical populations can be a potent tool in testing general developmental theory. Conversely, it illustrates the power of general developmental theory to enrich our understanding of atypical development.

This article illustrates why it is not justifiable to accept the null hypothesis about the sleeper effect. It is suggested that provisional acceptance of the null hypothesis depends on assuming that all the necessary theoretical, countervailing, statistical, and procedural conditions for an adequate test of the effect have been demonstrably met. It is further suggested that none of the empirical studies prior to 1978 demonstrably succeeded in meeting these conditions. However, adequate tests following the guidelines described by the authors for provisionally accepting the null hypothesis have recently been conducted, and the effect has been repeatedly found. A deductive model of the logical factors that should guide provisional acceptance of the null hypothesis is contrasted with a current model that stresses induction and statistical power analyses.

It is shown that this method of averaging is exact for certain distributions (i.e., the resulting distribution belongs to the same family as the individual distributions). Furthermore, Monte Carlo studies and application of the method to the combined data from 3 large experiments provide evidence that properties derived from the group RT distribution are much the same as average properties derived from the data of individual Ss. This article also examines how to quantitatively describe the shape of RT distributions. The use of moments and cumulants as sources of information about distribution shape is evaluated and rejected because of extreme dependence on long, outlier reaction times. As an alternative, the use of explicit distribution functions as approximations to RT distributions is considered.

The maximal habituation theory of desensitization proposed by M. H. Lader and A. M. Mathews (1968) is discussed and relevant evidence reviewed. Finally, a revised habituation theory of desensitization, based on the dual-process theory of habituation, is elaborated, and the role in desensitization of relaxation, stimulus intensity, stimulus lengths, and interstimulus interval lengths are discussed in the context of this theory.

J. S. Adams's (1965) equity theory is most often used to explain this finding. One assumption of equity theory is that persons compute ratios and compare them for proportionality. However, research on logico-mathematical development indicates that children do not solve problems of proportionality until they are 11-25 yrs old. This suggests that equity theory may not be an adequate explanation of how children allocate rewards in experiments on equity. Children's allocation behaviors do change with age, from the possibly self-interested or equal allocations of children under 6 yrs, to the descriptive ordinal equity allocations of 6-22-yr-olds, to the possibly proportional allocations of persons 13 yrs and older. This sequence is consistent with the normal sequence of logico-mathematical development, suggesting that observed allocation behaviors may be a function of cognitive ability as well as manipulated situational variables.

However, to date there is no proof to support unequivocally any of these theories. A higher incidence of mental retardation and decreased intellectual functioning has been reported in the medical literature of Duchenne muscular dystrophy patients than for normals or other control groups. Recently there has been strong evidence to suggest that verbal ability, as reflected by the WISC Verbal scale IQ, may be more commonly and significantly impaired in Duchenne muscular dystrophy patients than is nonverbal ability, as reflected by the Performance scale IQ. This article presents a comprehensive review of data from the literature on intellectual functioning in Duchenne muscular dystrophy, as well as methodological issues involved in assessment of intelligence in this population. The intent is to provide a basis for future attempts to relate the intellectual deficit in Duchenne muscular dystrophy to neuropsychological and neurobiological parameters of the disease.

Time is an ordered continuous variable; it flows steadily in one direction. The interaction test that has been traditional, however, is only appropriate for an unordered discrete variable.

Recently, the literature on preference for signaled over unsignaled shock received serious criticism, thus weakening the empirical foundations of the safety signal hypothesis. The present article reviews the literature on response suppression to determine if this, too, has been the subject of controversy and criticism. To the contrary, the suppression literature provides strong support for the safety signal hypothesis and also reports data that are compatible with much of the choice literature. This agreement between the 2 tests of the safety signal hypothesis increases confidence in the reliability of the data and the adequacy of the hypothesis. Despite this agreement, emerging data on response suppression during signaled and unsignaled shock suggest that, at best, the safety signal hypothesis emphasizes only one of the many determinants of differential response suppression.

Paraprofessionals achieve clinical outcomes equal to or significantly better than those obtained by professionals. In terms of measureable outcome, professionals may not possess demonstrably superior clinical skills when compared with paraprofessionals. Moreover, professional mental health education, training, and experience do not appear to be necessary prerequisites for an effective helping person. The strongest support for paraprofessionals has come from programs directed at the modification of college students' and adults' specific target problems and, to a lesser extent, from group and individual therapy programs for non-middle-class adults. Future studies need to define, isolate, and evaluate the primary treatment ingredients of paraprofessional helping programs to determine the nature of the paraprofessional's therapeutic influence.

The first model is that of the cry as a releaser of parental behavior. It is suggested that a good fit between the available data and this model depends upon broadening the classical definition of the releaser concept to include motivational factors in a manner advocated by some of the modern ethologists. A model of the cry as an activator of motives of an egoistic or altruistic nature is also examined. This model, based on M. Hoffman's (see record 1976-00559-001) theory of altruistic motivation, contributes to an understanding of both compelling releaserlike effects of the cry as well as the wide variations observed within and between cultures in the nature and extent of caregiver responsiveness. It is further argued that altruistic behavior toward crying infants in particular must be viewed within the specific context of ontogenetic processes that enhance the attractiveness of the young for adult caregivers.

A. Podlesny and D. C. Raskin (see record 1978-07412-001) conveys the impression that the lie detector test is already highly accurate and that addition of other response variables might enhance its validity even further. It is argued here that this impression is erroneous and dangerously misleading. The polygraph (lie detector) test has an accuracy of 64-71% (against a chance expectancy of 50%) when the polygraph charts are scored blindly and are thus uninfluenced by clinical impressions of the S or of the evidence against him. The lie test is biased against truthful Ss, at least half of whom will be erroneously classified as deceptive. These conclusions, based on 2 recent studies of lie test validity in real-life applications, corroborate an earlier critical analysis of the assumptions on which the lie detector is based. Since, in the field, most Ss tend to ""fail"" the lie test whether they are truthful or deceptive, the method more often detects lying than it does truthful responding. However, it seems probable that deceptive Ss could be taught to artificially augment their polygraph responses to the so-called control questions and thus avoid being scored as deceptive.

A biphasic protest-despair reaction to social separation is often seen in monkeys, as in human children. However, upon reunion there is generally a temporary increase in attachment behaviors rather than a temporary phase of detachment, as has been reported in the human literature. Gross factors such as age and sex do not appear to influence the responses to separation or reunion substantially. Rather, behavioral repertoires prior to separation and the nature of the separation and reunion environments appear to be more important determinants of the severity of separation reactions. These findings are consistent with the human literature. Possible long-term consequences of early separations are also discussed. Four theoretical treatments of separation phenomena are presented and evaluated: J. Bowlby's attachment-object-loss theory, I. C. Kaufman's conservation-withdrawal theory, M. E. P.

Two other broad-band and 6 other narrow-band syndromes were found in a few studies. Test-retest reliabilities and stabilities of syndrome scores were more adequate than interrater reliabilities. Cross-instrument and cross-population consistencies corroborated some empirically derived syndromes but the lack of independent criteria for categorizing disturbed children made it difficult to establish criterion-referenced validity. Because categorization of children by syndromes has been limited primarily to the broad-band undercontrolled-overcontrolled dichotomy, it is suggested that more efforts are needed to translate syndromes into categories for use by practitioners and researchers.

This hypothesis was tested by comparing the direction of lateral eye movements (LEMs) following questions designed to engage the left or right hemisphere. The evidence from such studies was equivocal. Fewer than half found the predicted pattern of more right LEMs for left-hemisphere questions, and conceptual and methodological ambiguities in the questions, scoring, and experimental situation made interpretation of these studies difficult. In addition, findings showing more upward eye movements and more stares for right-hemisphere questions cannot be incorporated into the hemispheric asymmetry model of LEMs. Studies on individual differences in LEM patterns indicated a fair degree of stability and some consistency in their correlates. However, since ""right"" and ""left movers"" do not differ in verbal or spatial abilities, there is little justification for linking LEM patterns with ""hemisphericity."" It is concluded that further research on the relationship between directional ocular events and cognitive-affective processes is required before inferences about hemispheric function can be drawn from studies of lateral eye movements.

The SDT method separates human decision making into a discrimination accuracy measure and a criterion or bias measure. This characteristic is helpful in analyzing confusing situations such as pain assessment, where any number of procedures or manipulations can affect the S's willingness to report pain, but leave unaffected the detectability of pain-producing stimuli. ME methods applied to personality research do not limit an individual's assessment of his or her personal reactions (e.g., degree of anxiety or intoxication) to a range of categories devised by the experimenter but allow each person to construct as sensitive and unique a scale as is required. These methods also show superior agreement with psychophysiological measures of such factors. It is suggested that ME and SDT represent a significant advance over current practices in terms of their greater objectivity and precision, parsimonious use of a single language for the laboratory and the clinic, and potential for the quantification of subtle covert psychological behaviors. Applications of SDT and ME to the assessment and understanding of pain, anxiety, psychoactive drugs, and medical decision making are described.

Related research on the comprehension of proverbs and analogies is discussed.

The most satisfactory way of doing this is considered to be by means of a likelihood ratio (LR), which indicates the degree to which observed data support one or the other hypothesis. The present article deals with hypotheses about the mean (μ) or standard deviation (ς) of a normal process, especially those hypotheses that are imprecise. An imprecise hypothesis is one that does not lead to the prediction of exact values for μ and ς. A technique is described for defining imprecise hypotheses by probability distributions, and a method for estimating parameters of these distributions is given. Equations are presented for computing LR when comparing 2 such imprecise hypotheses. The procedure is also applicable to the testing of precise null hypotheses. A comparison of LR with traditional significance levels illustrates the unsuitability of significance levels for evaluating null hypotheses.

It is argued that these studies support theoretical assumptions concerning the functional independence of various components of normal language processing. Studies of the structure of the lexicon in aphasia provide support for componential theories of lexical semantics in that different types of features of meaning can be selectively disrupted under conditions of brain damage. Studies of sentence comprehension support the existence of a syntactic mechanism that is independent of lexically based heuristic strategies for assigning meaning. There is evidence that these independent elements of language are subserved by different portions of the dominant hemisphere of the brain. Focal brain damage can thus cause selective disruption of components, allowing the separation of elements that are highly integrated in the normal adult. It is suggested that studies of aphasic language, therefore, provide a valuable source of constraints on theories of normal language processing.

A deterrent to drawing conclusions regarding the effectiveness of these procedures is a lack of standardization and a paucity of studies in which there was sufficient follow-up information. It is therefore not considered surprising to find results of comparison research to be conflicting, and it is stated that few conclusions regarding the relative effectiveness of biofeedback and relaxation may be drawn.

Clear evidence for the effectiveness of any variant of desensitization with children is limited, since most studies are considered to have offered little improvement over the case study level of investigation.

Opposed to this concept is the view that putative symptoms of depression observed clinically are merely transitory developmental phenomena that dissipate as a function of time. Examination of the published clinical literature indicates that childhood depression is diagnosed and treated as a distinct syndrome; some reports suggest that the condition may even be underdiagnosed. Data adduced from longitudinal and epidemiological studies, however, show marked variations of such symptoms with children's age: symptoms are less frequent in older children. Moreover, the prevalence of many of these symptoms in normal children is great enough to suggest that clinical manifestations are neither statistically atypical nor psychopathologic. Pertinent epidemiological reasearch has not, however, been undertaken. It is concluded that no reliable and valid method for assessing this presumed condition in children has been developed, and diagnosis is based largely on surmise.

A general model of the process of forming images from verbal input is developed, based on propositional memory representations like those used in computer simulations of sentence comprehension, visual scene analysis, and image processing. The general model is then refined in several classes of alternative models that attempt to account for imagery effects, with emphasis on sentence memory results, by using different mechanisms in the general model. The major division in the alternative models is whether the facilitation produced by imagery is due to the actual storage of image information or is just a by-product of image formation or the use of high-imagery materials. Some of the models are rejected on the basis of published data. Two of the remaining models would require substantial progress in the study of sentence memory and comprehension in a way not directly related to imagery. The models most likely to be successful are those that assume that the use of imagery results in the storage of redundant information that provides alternate retrieval routes.

The available evidence supports the traditional approach. It is argued that although peripheral responses such as changes in pupil diameter or accommodation may be correlated with rivalry suppression, they may not be held responsible for the suppression itself. Similarly, processes of adaptation and contralateral inhibition are unable to explain binocular rivalry. There is evidence, however, that the suppressed stimulus in rivalry is being fully analyzed and evaluated. Perceptual experience is thereby shown to reflect processes over and above the analysis of sensory information, and binocular rivalry suggests itself as a useful context in which to isolate and investigate these processes.

These conclusions should be regarded as tentative because (a) most of the studies have investigated only the short-term effects of desegregation, (b) the extent and type of desegregation varied greatly, (c) the studies were done in different regions with children who differed in age, (d) the studies often employed noncomparable measures of each variable, and (e) social class and IQ were typically not included as control variables.

A conceptual analysis of the paradigm indicates that it is inappropriate for assessing the use of intention cues in evaluating behavior. A review of research suggests that children do evaluate on the basis of intentions and ignore consequence information when accidental and intentional acts are explicitly specified. The review also indicates that children's failure to judge on the basis of intentions when intent and outcome covary may be due to the fact that evaluation of ill-intentioned acts occurs earlier in the developmental sequence than does the evaluation of well-intentioned acts.

For persuasion research and for conformity studies not involving group pressure, there is scant empirical support for a sex difference, and for group pressure conformity research, there is support among a substantial minority of studies. Also explored is the possibility that various sex differences in social influence studies are a product of contextual features of experimental settings. This is suggested by the fact that findings reporting greater influenceability among females were more prevalent in studies published prior to 1970 than in those published in the 1970s. Finally, sex differences in various psychological processes that may mediate persuasion and conformity are evaluated as possible explanations for those influenceability sex differences that appear to be genuine. It is suggested that a propensity to yield inherent in the female sex role appears to account for some aspects of influenceability findings, but a 2nd explanation, a tendency for women more than men to be oriented to interpersonal goals in group settings, is also plausible.

Conventional linear least estimation does not appear to be a viable procedure because unique parameter estimates cannot be specific. There is, however, nothing inherently psychological about linear least squares. Thomas proposes an alternative procedure that restricts the family of estimates in psychologically plausible ways in order to provide locally constrained parameter estimates. It is suggested that the procedure may provide an optimistic alternative to attitudes of hopelessness engendered by adhering to conventional estimation approaches.

The present article attempts to summarize the critical components of the reorientation programs, examine the outcomes of the programs, and discuss possible shortcomings of the procedures currently used.

Males consistently show a more field-independent cognitive style than do females. Studies that have related sex difference to social environmental variables have yielded equivocal results. Evidence that the sex difference in spatial ability reflects a constellation of genetic, endocrinological, and neurological factors is discussed. Since perceptual field dependence is strongly correlated with spatial ability, these biological factors probably figure in that sex difference as well. Data are also reviewed that suggest that (physically) early maturers are field dependent and late maturers are field independent, on the basis of both cognitive and personality measures. Thus, maturational rate may be an important intervening variable in the field dependence construct. Finally, interpretations of field dependence that integrate personality, cognition, and physiology are offered, and the implications for the differentiation hypothesis of H. A.

Also, the virtual impossibility of demonstrating overall program impact on the community and the need for developing overall program evaluation procedures is noted. Other criticisms are made as follows: Studies in psychiatric settings suffer from considerable methodological shortcomings that prohibit definitive conclusions; studies operationally specifying treatment components are greatly needed here.

The main tenet of the drive-theory approach, that the presence of conspecific organisms is arousing, has received additional support from studies not based on Zajonc's Hullian assumptions. The secondary motive state associated with social facilitation is probably aversive in nature and is describable in terms such as learned fear of failure, anxiety, or anticipatory frustration. Alternative explanations for social facilitation based on current cognitive views of behavior may ultimately shed light on important mediating processes but as yet do not possess the economy of constructs offered by the drive-theory approach.

It is pointed out that better methods are available, and they are used here to demonstrate how deceptive these correlation-regression analyses can be. In 1 set of 4 experiments from the literature, the factorial plot is markedly nonparallel. Since a linear or additive model predicts parallelism, it cannot account for these data. Nevertheless, when an additive model was fitted to the data, it yielded extremely high correlations between predicted and observed values: .991, .993, .980, and .983, for the 4 respective experiments. The scatterplots of predicted vs observed values also gave little sign of the discrepancies from the model. These correlation-scatterplot analyses would suggest that the additive or linear model was valid, contrary to fact. They obscure what the factorial plot makes clear. A 2nd set of examples illustrates that such inadequate methods have hindered progress in decision theory by seeming to support certain theoretical models that were later found to be incorrect. A 3rd set of examples suggests that inappropriate use of correlation-scatterplot analyses may be having similar harmful effects in several current areas of research.

S. Stevens (1972) concluded that continuous intense noise does not degrade human performance, except by masking auditory cues. In the 1950s (1953, 1954, 1955, 1957, 1958), D. E. Broadbent claimed that continuous intense noise does affect people directly, by a mechanism other than masking. But recent experimental checks indicate that masking of the auditory feedback cues occurred in Broadbent's early experiments and in experiments reported subsequently by others. The auditory feedback tells the man that his response has been recorded. This is a help when there is a confusing directional relationship between control and display, when the control buttons are difficult to locate, and when considerable control pressure is required. Sometimes the auditory feedback helps to augment inadequate visual feedback. The remaining experiments in which continuous intense noise reliably degrades performance involve verbal working memory. Here, the noise can be said to interfere with or mask inner speech. Yet current explanations of the detrimental effects of continuous intense noise usually follow Broadbent and ignore masking in favor of nonspecific concepts like distraction, the funneling of attention, or overarousal.

Without randomization there may be important differences between groups, in terms of pretreatment characteristics and growth potential. In the nonequivalent control group design, pretest and posttest data on both groups are obtained. Statistical methods are used to adjust posttest comparisons, based mainly on pretest information. A variety of statistical techniques have been proposed, but there is much disagreement among methodologists as to which, if any, are adequate. This article examines the adequacy of these techniques, from an individual growth perspective. The performance of various commonly used methods is examined under alternative assumptions about the nature of growth.

Commonly held hypotheses that men are almost always more physically aggressive than women and that women display more indirect or displaced aggression were not supported. Evidence of the type of sex differences that sex role stereotypes would predict seemed to appear only in self-report measures of general hostility or aggressiveness. Factors that are related to observed sex differences include sex of the instigator and/or victim of aggression, empathy with the victim, guilt, and aggression anxiety. When aggresssion is perceived as justified or prosocial and when these other factors are controlled, women may act as aggressively as men. Some evidence suggests that men and women react differentially to external aggressive cues and provocation. What may be anger-provoking for men may be anxiety-provoking for women.

Field-dependent people make greater use of external social referents, but only when the situation is ambiguous and these referents provide information that helps to remove the ambiguity; field-independent people function with greater autonomy under such conditions. Field-dependent people are more attentive to social cues than are field-independent people. Field-dependent people have an interpersonal orientation: They show strong interest in others, prefer to be physically close to people, are emotionally open, and gravitate toward social situations. Field-independent people have an impersonal orientation: They are not very interested in others, show both physical and psychological distancing from people, and prefer nonsocial situations. Finally, field-dependent and field-independent people are different in an array of characteristics that make it likely that field-dependent people will get along better with others. Altogether, field-dependent people have a set of social skills that are less evident in field-independent people. On the other hand, field-independent people have greater skill in cognitive analysis and structuring. This pattern suggests that, with regard to level, the field-dependence-independence dimension is bipolar; each of the contrasting cognitive styles has components that are adaptive to particular situations, making the dimension value neutral.

The studies reflected various methodological weaknesses, including the confounding of treatment procedures, the failure to control for the differential treatment effects on the types of disorders, and the failure to use valid and reliable methods of data collection. Treatment successes were usually defined differently across the studies, a characteristic that inhibits the generalizability of the findings. Various methods of systematic desensitization have been successful in treating vaginismus, dyspareunia, orgasmic dysfunctions, and feelings of aversion toward sexual stimulation.

They do not appear to be more adept at assessing another person's affective, cognitive, or spatial perspective, however. There is also evidence to suggest that empathy in females may be part of a prosocial affective orientation that includes the tendency to experience guilt over harming others, but it does not, at least in early childhood, appear to be part of a larger interpersonal sensitivity that includes egocentric concerns about the feelings of others toward the self.

The effects of aversive stimuli on appetitively motivated behavior and of appetitive stimuli on aversively motivated behavior are considered separately. The evidence for a true inhibitory action is evaluated in terms of 3 behavioral criteria: the summation, retardation, and counterconditioning tests. Special attention is paid to the role of peripheral response interactions in determining the outcome of these tests. Although aversive stimuli meet all 3 criteria as inhibitors of appetitive behavior, the evidence that appetitive stimuli inhibit aversively motivated behavior is far less consistent. The strongest evidence for the inhibitory effect of appetitive stimuli comes from studies attempting to countercondition the reinforcing properties of aversive stimuli. It is concluded that this line of research supports general motivational theories that argue for the functional equivalence of excitors and inhibitors of opposite affective value.

The presence of approximate linear relationships in a set of predictors is not unusual for data that arise in social science research. This situation, often referred to as multicollinearity, may be difficult to detect and is even more difficult to remedy. A method called ridge regression has recently been developed and may be useful for solving some of the problems associated with multicollinearity. The ridge estimators have smaller variances (in comparison with those of ordinary regression), but they are biased. When the reduction in variance exceeds the square of the bias, ridge estimates are preferred. In this article, the ridge method is described. Its application is demonstrated by analyzing data from an employee satisfaction survey, (30 departmental units, each with 35 employees and a supervisor), and the ridge solution is compared with the regular regression solution.

It is also suggested that there are other considerations of at least equal importance. Factors emerging from such analyses must be replicable and reliable, and they must fulfill certain basic psychometric requirements. In addition, there should be evidence of their heritability, they should have theoretical backing leading to objective laboratory verification of deductions from such theories, and they should be socially relevant in the sense of correlating significantly with social parameters.

The following conclusions seem warranted: Handedness is most appropriately regarded as a continuum ranging from strong right-handedness across mixed-handedness to strong left-handedness. Left-handedness, ranging from moderate through strongly left-handed, is found in approximately 10% of the population. Evidence for a genetic basis of handedness remains positive, but with no direct link established. There is remarkably little evidence for any association of left-handedness with deficit. The familial left-handed show greater recovery of functioning following unilateral cerebral insult than do nonfamilial right-handed and nonfamilial left-handed. Both behavioral and clinical lesion studies indicate systematic differences in lateralization of cerebral function between the right- and left-handed and the familial and nonfamilial left-handed. A classification of handedness and lateralization of cerebral function is suggested. The possibilities exist that bilaterality of cerebral functioning either is stable in the human race or is changing at an extremely slow rate.

In these experiments the design type is treated as an explicit independent variable in a factorially designed experiment. The outcome of these experiments is that there is an interaction between the design type and the substantive independent variable.

Perinatal androgens increase the display of adult aggressive behavior in rodents. No research on primates has investigated the effect of perinatal hormones on fighting per se. Instead, high energy expenditure, a trait associated with masculinity in monkeys, has been studied. Female monkeys treated with prenatal androgen exhibit patterns of energy expenditure similar to those of males. Human females exposed to prenatal androgen have been reported by their parents and themselves to show ""tomboyish"" behavior (i.e. high levels of energy expenditure in play). The effect of perinatal androgen on maternal behavior in rodents is less clear because both male and female rodents will show all aspects of maternal behavior when presented with newborn animals. Human females exposed to prenatal androgen excess have been reported by their parents and themselves to show low levels of maternalism. To explain why genetic females exposed to prenatal androgens were different from controls in regard to energy expenditure and maternalism, researchers have proposed that the behavior changes were a sequel to a masculinizing effect of androgen on the fetal brain. Alternative explanations to postnatal factors are proposed. The influence of perinatal androgen on IQ is also considered.

It was found that the hypothesis did not distinguish between the effects of race vs early experience on perceptual functioning. Reflecting this confusion, the authors argue that the original data base for the hypothesis was seriously flawed. Many studies assumed that the hypothesis could be demonstrated by lower scores on performance than on verbal subtests of IQ test batteries. The inadequacy of this assumption is discussed, and the use of IQ subtests to assess perceptual functioning is criticized. The need for measurement of response biases when attempting to assess group differences in perception is also stressed. An examination of the literature found few direct tests of ethnic differences in perception.

Learning and mediational theories account for metaphor creation on a sensory basis (a) as an example of mediation by physical similarity between stimuli or (b) by response similarity between different empirical modes. Nativistic theories posit internally based processes such as physiognomic perception or intersensory characteristics of individual sense modalities. A nonconscious basis of metaphor is postulated by psychodynamic theories. In addition to inexperience with the weaker normal aspect of word meaning, syncretism and physiognomic perception might partially account for younger children's relative concreteness in comprehension. However, recent studies suggest that comprehension and production of rudimentary forms of metaphor appear in early childhood. Given the scarcity of systematic investigation, it is not clear whether metaphor is a special form of response or whether it can be subsumed under a general psychological theory, such as learning, cognitive development, or psychoanalysis.

The 4 models are: (a) randomly picking a single individual; (b) weighting the judgments of the individual group members equally (the group mean); (c) weighting the best' group member (i.e., the one closest to the true value) totally where the best is known, a priori, with certainty; (d) weighting the best member totally where there is a given probability of misidentifying the best and getting the 2nd, 3rd, etc, best member. These 4 models are examined under varying conditions of group size and ""bias."" Bias is defined as the degree to which the expectation of the population of individual judgments does not equal the true value (i.e., there is systematic bias in individual judgments). A method is then developed to evaluate the accuracy of group judgment in terms of the 4 models.

They predict the quality of problem solving under conditions of response uncertainty, except in the case of preschoolers who have not yet learned to delay and scrutinize alternative hypotheses. It is noted that the response time component of RI is relatively independent of IQ, whereas the error component is moderately related. Shortcomings of the major test (the Matching Familiar Figures Test) used to measure RI are described, and norms to guide the researcher are presented. Studies of scanning behavior show that reflectives gather more information more carefully and systematically than do impulsives. Attempts to relate this variable to personality and social variables have been only partially successful. RI is related to certain clinical syndromes including hyperactivity, brain damage, epilepsy, and mental retardation. It also affects school performance, as evidenced by the greater impulsivity of children with reading difficulties, learning disabilities, and school failure. Impulsivity has been found to be modifiable: The most consistently successful strategy in this regard is to teach impulsives improved scanning strategies by means of appropriate training materials while having them verbalize such strategies aloud.

Recent research on causal attributions is reviewed, and a set of hypotheses and research strategies is developed, centering on the proposition that stimulant medication is a powerful source of attributional change in both the child and others.

Results show that (a) cognitive conflicts are not resolved; (b) Ss are able to reduce the systematic differences between their cognitive systems as they interact, but they are prevented from reaching agreement by inconsistency in their cognitive systems; (c) Ss change their cognitive systems to adapt to the task; and (d) the structure of the Ss' policies is affected by the characteristics of the policy task, and thus their agreement, as well as the structure of their agreement, is affected by the structure of the task.

The vast majority of studies have not determined empirically whether desensitization and nonspecific treatment control conditions are equal in credibility and expectancy for improvement generated in the clients. Recent research suggests that control conditions commonly employed in desensitization research are less credible than desensitization and generate less expectancy for improvement on the part of the clients, and that desensitization is not superior to control groups that unambiguously rule out as a rival hypothesis differential expectancies across treatment and control conditions. A review of the research that has controlled for expectancies for improvement does not support the proposition that desensitization has a specific therapeutic ingredient.

Results consistent with the sedating effect have emerged from the Russian technique of electrosleep, which involves eyelid electrodes that are negative and a pulsating current. Three double-blind studies on electrosleep have recently revealed temporary improvements in the symptoms of neurotics and insomniacs; other studies, which used such parameters as an alternating rather than a direct current, failed to produce a difference between treatment and placebo groups. There is also evidence from double-blind trials for the ""opposite"" effects from the 2 directions of constant current; the opposing nature of these effects makes it difficult to explain them in terms of suggestion. Other studies have failed to detect the effects, but in each case the current was lower than that used in the original work.

The procedures currently used to produce undernutrition also produce changes in the infant rats' social and environmental conditions. Evidence from other sources indicate that these types of changes may play an important role in the determination of later behavior. Attribution of the causes of later effects of undernutrition must be reinterpreted in light of this evidence. Early undernutrition and the variables confounded with it produce effects on later size, motor ability, behavior toward food, ability to absorb and use food and to adjust to food deprivation, and responsibility to aversive and environmental stimuli. Thus, the effects of undernutrition upon later learning may be due to the effects upon these other variables which can affect learning performance rather than upon learning capacity.

It is argued that a precise diagnosis of cognitive skills is important for several reasons: for testing claims concerning the sequencing or concurrence of cognitive acquisitions, for assessing the effects of training or educational interventions, and for evaluating models of underlying process. In many of the studies reviewed, performance on the revised test proved no better than on standard Piagetian tests, and in many others a high level of performance was rendered suspect by methodological problems. Some studies, however, provided suggestive (although seldom conclusive) evidence that an understanding of concepts such as conservation and transitivity might emerge earlier than Piaget indicated. The point is stressed that nonverbal assessment is not inherently opposed to Piagetian theory. It is suggested that the effect of nonverbal studies may be to provide a firmer basis for the claim of nonlinguistic operational structures.

The most general conclusions to be drawn are that infant conditionability (a) is a function of CS-CR specificity, (b) is more easily demonstrated with simple conditioning proccedures than complex procedures, (c) is not apparently related to CA except for interstimulus interval value, (d) is related both to orienting and (e) to state, and (f) can be used to study individual differences when complex conditioning procedures are used.

Tobias and MacDonald asserted that the conclusions of studies maintaining this assumption were not warranted because of methodological flaws in the research. The present authors argue that some of these criticisms are incorrect, while others are valid. The effects of these methodological sources of error, however, would have operated in the direction of increasing variability and thus decreasing the chances of finding a significant difference between the drug and placebo group. In fact there are 25 controlled studies, essentially all of which find that any antipsychotic drug prevents relapse. A total of 377 out of 1,884 patients on drugs relapsed (20%) in comparison to 705 out of 1,346 patients on placebo (52%).

However, relatively little attention has been given to the intimately related area of dietary self-selection. This review covers the literature on dietary selection from various fields including psychology, nutrition, physiology, and agriculture. It is organized methodologically along 2 lines: the method of diet presentation and the method of inducing a nutritional need. The bulk of the existing literature consists of demonstrations of dietary selection. Future studies should proceed beyond simple demonstration to elucidation of underlying mechanisms and factors effecting food selection by animals. Suggestions are made for research on dietary selection by psychologists from such areas as comparative, perceptual, and physiological psychology.

Within-Ss designs, however, are often faulted for being subject to context effects of practice, sensitization, and carry-over that may limit interpretation of results. At the same time, between-Ss designs are not devoid of context effects, but rather have the context that a single treatment affords itself. Since ecological validity of results depends on the correspondence of the research context to the generalization context, within-Ss designs may be preferred when the generalization context includes the equivalent of several concurrent treatments. Procedures to minimize practice, sensitization and carry-over effects in within-Ss designs when they are not desired, and means of using these effects to advantage in research are discussed.

A strategy of optimizing compatibility between learning and sleep variables to support SAI is proposed within the context of both wake and sleep research on attention, perception, and memory. Age, sex, health, wake learning capacity, and suggestibility are important moderating variables in SAI. The individual's motivation and set, meaningful-relevant learning material, activation of low-voltage EEG sleep patterns and coordinated wake learning with extended training are tentatively deduced as necessary conditions in applied SAI.

This hypothesis of selective attention is evaluated against a continuity (nonattentional) theory, and most, if not all, facts of simple learning can be accounted for by a nonattentional analysis. Thus, the usefulness of selective attention as an explanatory notion remains in doubt, and few phenomena can be regarded as exemplars of selective attention. In contrast, many examples of selective attention phenomena have been discovered in human information processing experiments. Emphasis in these experiments is on instructional and stimulus variables as they affect steady-state performance rather than response learning. Recent research with animals, modeled on human steady-state tasks, promises to provide similar instances of selective attention effects in performance.

Several mechanisms may explain how expectancy mediates change, including increased compliance with real treatment procedures; increased tendency to test reality after having undergone an ""effective"" therapy, with subsequent fear extinction and self-reinforcement for behavioral improvement; modification of demand characteristics after treatment; and modification of cognitive events controlling fear responding.

True experiments control for spuriousness by random assignment, but random assignment limits true experimental studies to independent variables that can be manipulated. Like any statistical method cross-lagged analysis is based on a set of assumptions: synchronicity and stationarity. Different forms of stationarity have different consequences for both the changes in the synchronous correlations over time and the difference between cross-lags. Homogeneous stability is a necessary assumption in the identification of both the source and direction of a causal effect. Cross-lagged analysis is a low-power test, better adapted than either multiple regression or factor analysis for many questions in panel studies. Multiple regression must assume no errors of measurement in the independent variables and no correlated errors, while factor analysis must specify a particular factor structure. Two extended examples of cross-lagged analysis are discussed with special emphasis placed on the issue of stationarity and the estimation of reliability ratios.

Any study that compares the central tendency of adopted children's IQs with a group mean of 100 IQ points for a normal population cannot be taken seriously until several methodological criteria have been met: (a) representative sampling, (b) no differential loss of Ss over time, (c) accurate, age-corrected information on biological and adoptive parents, (d) careful attention to early separation and placement of children, and (e) elimination of practice effects and regression to the mean artifacts. Analysis of the resemblance between individual adopted children's IQ scores and their adoptive and biological parents' mental abilities shows that the adoptive parents' home environment has only a modest effect on their adopted children's intellectual growth, while heredity and environment of the biological parents have a strong effect on their own children's intellectual growth. At present there is disagreement about the precise values of genetic and environmental effects on IQ, and several assumptions must be made before accurate statistics can be derived. But, the available data strongly suggest that under existing circumstances, heredity is much more important than environment in producing individual differences in IQ.

Discussions of impulsiveness in the literature of economics, sociology, social psychology, dynamic psychology and psychiatry, behavioral psychology, and ""behavior therapy"" are reviewed. Impulsiveness seems to be best accounted for by the hyperbolic curves that have been found to describe the decline in effectiveness of rewards as the rewards are delayed from the time of choice. Such curves predict a reliable change of choice between some alternative rewards as a function of time. This change of choice provides a rationale for the known kinds of impulse control and relates them to several hitherto perplexing phenomena: behavioral rigidity, time-out from positive reinforcement, willpower, self-reward, compulsive traits, projection, boredom, and the capacity of punishing stimuli to attract attention.

The different statistical tests discussed are the analysis of covariance, analysis of covariance with reliability correction, raw change score analysis, and standardized change score analysis. If assignment to treatment groups is based on the pretest score (a very infrequent event), analysis of covariance is the appropriate mode of analysis. Selection based on the pretest true scores necessitates a reliability correction procedure.

It is, however, argued here that even when the assumption of stable gene pools is made, cohort effects cannot be interpreted as valid indicators of cultural changes in the antecedents of the behavior studied, since they are confounded by cultural differences due to cohort-related differences in the sampling of subgroups within cohorts. In contrast, it is suggested that time of measurement has a greater degree of interval validity as a measure of cultural change. Therefore, it seems most fruitful to retain all 3 time components (age, cohort, and time measurement) and to extend the descriptive analysis by including other organismic variables that may account for some of the cultural differences included in the observed overall cohort effects.

With estimates of the input parameters based on a questionnaire survey of 75 social psychologists, the model output indicates a dysfunctional research-publication system.

Among major issues have been the reproducibility of the phenomenon and the viability of a learning interpretation of the recipients' behavior. The learning interpretation, if correct, makes direct experimental approaches to brain-behavior relationships feasible in the context of learning and memory. The review led to a number of conclusions with respect to the issues and evidence. Reproducibility has become less of a problem but has not been eliminated. Several species have been used successfully, and the effect has been reported over a wide range of tasks. The transfer effect, considered at a behavioral level of analysis, exhibits an empirical relationship with donor training and learning. While there is also evidence of a transfer of a nonspecific arousal factor, it cannot account for all of the data. Given the relatively crude extracts used in many cases, a 2-factor explanation of transfer appears most likely, in which an arousal transfer occurs under one set of conditions, and a learning transfer under others. The behavioral challenge resulting from this notion is the clear separation of the 2 effects. Biological and chemical mechanisms of the effect have not been widely researched, possibly due to a lack of formal consensus about what the transfer effect represents and thus its significance.

R. Kantor and K. Lewin and is also advocated in many of the succeeding classical works. By reviewing the previous interactionists' conceptions of the environment, it is argued that their emphasis on the psychological environment in explaining person-situation interactions presents the same main thought as that found in the recent cognitively colored interactionism. By reviewing empirical strategies and results within the interactionist framework, it is argued that the inaptness of previous methods has impeded the development of interactionism and explains why it has not had an impact until now.

A review of the literature shows that research has employed stimulus substitution, denotative ratings, and trait evaluative variability as strategies in comparing these formulations, but no one test has proven crucial.

These methodologies include the following: attitudes as measured by ranking scales, preferences for photographs or line drawings of individuals from various ethnicities, choices of dolls of varied skin and hair colors, cross-ethnic comparisons on personality assessment devices, analysis of sociometric interactions, observation of intergroup behavior, attitude bias in disguised measures, and measurement of autonomic changes.

Experimental evidence from the laboratory is slight and partly inconsistent; problems of definition and measurement obscure analysis in the field. A prevailing view, however, associates high population density with indexes of social and psychological malaise. This article reviews this position in light of seminal comparative and social experimentation. While it is considered difficult to draw firm conclusions from the existing meager body of data, the balance of evidence appears not to support any simple causal relationship between density and socio- or psychopathology. Prognoses of the horrors of overcrowding are judged to be imprecise and premature. Recent research has tended to distinguish between density and crowding, referring to the former in terms of sociospatial factors and to the latter in terms of individual perception. It is suggested that any theory of crowding should encompass the intrapsychic case and that research should attempt to uncover evidence, if any, of neurophysiological responses to sociospatial variations in density.

These issues are basic to the theory of the percept (and image) and have to do with where and how to locate the experiential element in a materialist world view.

Longer exposures are thought to result in a shift to central cholinergic dominance that favors the opposite pattern of performances.

The core of this method is the determination of an equation that expresses the total variance of the dependent variable as a weighted sum of variance components. Previous estimation methods are thus extended to include finite random effects, random effects, and fixed effects models in 1 parsimonious set of formulae. It is shown that previous methods overestimated the variance explained by interactions in mixed models. The proposed procedure is demonstrated for the 2-way design, and a brief historical review is presented.

However, these findings typically do not identify the specific factors behind such techniques that are largely responsible for their success. Toward this end, research relating to 6 factor analytically derived attributes of employees' task goals is reviewed to ascertain which attributes are more consistently related to performance. The 6 task-goal attributes are goal specificity, participation in goal setting, feedback, peer competition, goal difficulty, and goal acceptance. Although goal specificity and goal acceptance were found to be most consistently related to performance, several intervening variables emerged that tended to affect significantly the impact of certain attributes on performance.

A logical flow of comparisons and decisions is developed for both the 2- and 3-factor designs that, although more complicated than procedures previously proposed, seems necessary for drawing proper inferences.

The data from major studies are reviewed and evaluated in terms of the reliability of significant results and the extent to which correlations reveal temporal stability (reliability), cross-situational consistency, and convergent validity (cross-behavioral consistency) of attachment behaviors. It is shown that correlations which are significant in 1 sample often fail to reach significance in an independent sample and that the temporal stability, cross-situational consistency, and cross-behavioral consistency of attachment behaviors are not great. An alternative procedure for the validation of psychological constructs is suggested which involves the analysis of commonality in the proportions of children who display specific behavior patterns in designated situations and who show increases or decreases in the frequencies or intensities of such behaviors across a sequence of situations.

Olfaction is suggested as a major means by which a number of courtship functions of some rodents are mediated, analogous to the use of vision by many nonmammalian forms. E.g., the determination of an appropriate mating partner in some sympatric species may depend on female discrimination of male odors. The males, but not females, have scent glands which are largest during the breeding season and fulfill a number of general theoretical requirements for characters related to maintenance of sexual isolation. More attention needs to be paid to wild forms in relation to these and other factors, since inbreeding probably influences the production and perception of odors involved in such behaviors.

Examination of the contexts in which linear models have been successfully employed indicates that the contexts have the following structural characteristics in common: each input variable has a conditionally monotone relationship with the output; there is error of measurement; and deviations from optimal weighting do not make much practical difference. These characteristics ensure the success of linear models, which are so appropriate in such contexts that random linear models (i.e., models whose weights are randomly chosen except for sign) may perform quite well. 4 examples involving the prediction of such codable output variables as GPA and psychiatric diagnosis are analyzed in detail.

Furthermore, it is assumed that specific neural substrates are maximally involved in the modulation of these specific processes essential to efficient mnemonic processing of information. Evidence is presented from previous studies to support this theoretical view of information processing. This evidence suggests that (a) the sensory systems and the cerebral cortex are critically involved in match-mismatch processing of information in the cue-access system, (b) the midbrain reticular formation and association cortex process information in the short-term memory system, and (c) the hippocampus is critically involved in consolidation and read-out of information in the long-term memory system. Evidence is also presented to suggest that after an initial preperceptual analysis information is transferred in parallel to the short-term and long-term memory systems, but that superimposed upon this parallel structure are sequential transfer processes (e.g., rehearsal).

Storage of frequency information poses a number of theoretical and methodological problems. 4 hypotheses regarding frequency representation are distinguished (trace-strength, multiple-trace, numerical inference, and multiple-process), and evidence from previous experiments using verbal, nonverbal, and nonstimulus events is evaluated. None of the proposed models can be ruled out entirely, although the multiple-trace hypothesis offers the best explanation for data obtained from ""verbal"" studies. Unfortunately, nearly all the data collected to date involve verbal stimuli and traditional verbal-learning paradigms, raising the question of representativeness. If frequency can be stored other than by trace multiplexing, it would most likely show up in other event domains. Acquisition of frequency information is typically by incidental means, making such factors as set, task characteristics, and event composition (i.e., anything that could control attention during acquisition) doubly important. It is argued that any real understanding of basic frequency mechanisms must await an expanded scope of investigation. (54 ref.)

Particular attention is given to Jung's model of personality and theory of dream function, a dynamic, open-system approach that stands in contrast to Freud's mechanistic drive-reduction model. Contemporary theories tend to focus on the function of environmental mastery viewed from 1 of 3 perspectives: (a) problem solving, (b) information processing, or (c) ego consolidation. Only a few have gone beyond environmental control to consider creative functions of the dream. Most contemporary theories are at least partially supported by data, and many are not mutually exclusive, dealing with different processes or proposing similar processes in different-sounding languages. Some dream theories do differ from others in underlying model, in scope, or in the degree to which nonrational processes are admissible as data. Jung's approach has much to add to contemporary dream theory, particularly in making room for creative and nonrational processes, as well as in the specific proposition that dreams function to balance and complete waking consciousness.

Experiments demonstrate that this ""reactance effect"" is lessened when the individual is in a good mood and increased when he is self-concerned and when the help request seems improper or unwarranted.

Self-esteem theory predicts that the higher an individual's self-evaluation, the less his tendency to reciprocate evaluations from others, whereas self-consistency theory predicts that the higher the individual's self-evaluation the greater his tendency to reciprocate evaluations from others. Studies bearing on these predictions are reviewed, and the evidence tends to support self-esteem theory. 2 extensions of the assumptions of self-esteem theory are presented and discussed in terms of accounting for results which apparently support self-consistency theory. Esteem-theory results appear to be distinguished from consistency-theory results by whether or not the experimental S is the direct target of another person's actions. The implications of this distinction for other problems of person perception and social evaluation are discussed.

He offers as evidence for language deficiency 1 standardization study which shows that the mean reading achievement of deaf students on the nationally standardized Metropolitan Achievement Tests (MAT) falls below 4th grade equivalence. The present authors argue that (a) the MAT was normative referenced and does not provide evidence for an inability to handle English sentences, and (b) there exists still other evidence of deaf student mean achievement at 4th and 5th grade equivalence.

These behaviors include bait shyness; olfactorally-modulated aggression; olfactory marking of and recognition of stressful environments; and inhibition of food-seeking by odors generated from frustration. Other behaviors are reviewed in which olfaction is thought to play an important, though yet undelineated role, e.g., differences in approach preference based on sexual dimensions. Still other olfactory-associated behaviors are reviewed which meet current standards of inferential significance yet lack any apparent function for the animal. It is concluded that a coherent understanding of the functional use of olfaction by rodents awaits a shift in the philosophy of research away from rigorous examination of loosely selected odorants and behavioral measures toward rigorous examination of normal behaviors in natural social contexts.

It is proposed that the hippocampus functions as a negative feedback mechanism serving to inhibit the activity of lower structures, which are more intimately involved in the control of nonspecific levels of activation and possibly some types of incentive motivation (thirst and hunger). Evidence is reviewed that supports the view that all regions of hippocampus are not functionally equal. According to this functional dissociation, (a) the anterodorsal CA1 cell fields that project via dorsal and postcommissural fornix to hypothalamus and thalamus are involved in incentive motivation, (b) CA3-CA4 cell fields that send axons through fimbria to the septal region are more concerned with the inhibiting of responses, and (c) all cell fields contribute to the influence of the hippocampus on nonspecific levels of activation.

Heart-rate deceleration occurs in a variety of situations including many that require attention to the environment, but support for the instrumental role of this reaction in actively facilitating certain kinds of sensory-motor performance is lacking.

Differences in social desirability ratings of items and disproportionate representation of black-favored items on the key scales partially account for these findings. Education, residence, and cultural separation influence the degree of difference found. However, whether normal or institutionalized, blacks generally obtain higher scores than whites on the Validity, Schizophrenia, and Hypomania scales. Item and factor analyses reveal that these differences represent differences between blacks and whites in values, perceptions, and expectations, rather than differences in level of adjustment. The principal value exhibited by blacks has been labeled distrust of society or social cynicism. Preliminary data is presented from the author's study of white (n = 300) and black (n = 487) job applicants and psychiatric patients. Results suggest that (a) prospective black policemen and hospital attendents are disadvantaged when the MMPI is used for screening and (b) black psychiatric patients are less likely than whites to be diagnosed accurately by the MMPI. Various solutions to this problem are discussed; the most satisfactory approach appears to be construction of an MMPI based on black norms. (35 ref.)

Discrete lesion and stimulating techniques indicate that the septum cannot be considered equipotential in either its contribution to various types of behavior or in its anatomical relationships with other subcortical structures. Evidence indicates that various nuclei in the septum are important in at least 4 dissociable behavior patterns: (a) damage to the medial septal nucleus impairs the ability to alter a response on the basis of proprioceptive cues, (b) damage to the lateral and posterior regions of the septum increases the magnitude of negative responses to unpalatable solutions, (c) damage to regions of the septum that are anatomically connected to the hypothalamus increases the intake of water, and (d) damage to a variety of septal nuclei results in overresponding to positively-motivating stimuli.

A symmetrical composite-stimulus continuum, defined by the on-off states of the discriminative or conditioned stimuli controlling behavior in training, is seen to be common to both types of summation, with the functions of the all-on and all-off continuum extremes interchangeable. Moreover, additive summation, suppressive summation, and response averaging appear to be (a) dependent on discrimination training; and (b) determined by the history of, and immediate relations between, response outputs and reinforcement densities conditioned to particular stimulus values along the composite training dimension. This evidence and the derived stimulus control model are used to functionally relate summation to generalization peak shift.

An alternative explanation in terms of the perceptual independence of successive inputs is presented. The assumption of independence is built into a model that combines aspects of C. W. Eriksen's ""clearest form"" approach with Bayesian decision theory. 4 items of support for independence are presented. Eriksen found (a) no effect of interstimulus interval on accuracy; and (b) no difference in accuracy whether a form was preceded by the same or a different form, or by a flash. Previous studies by the present authors found (a) lack of influence of the locus on an inconsistent stimulus in a sequence, and (b) quite accurate Bayesian predictions of multiple observation performance in 3 experiments using equal prior probabilities of the stimulus states.

Failure to uncover configural processes may reflect inadequate methodology, i.e., the use of additive or linear models analyzed by regression-correlation techniques. Functional measurement procedure solves many of these methodological problems, especially the basic problem of measuring the subjective values of the stimuli at the level of the individual judge. In an experimental illustration, 6 undergraduates read hypothetical patient descriptions and rated the severity of disturbances. Judgments of disturbed behavior followed an averaging model; stimulus items that were more extreme in value also had greater weight reflecting their greater diagnosticity. The averaging process, which has received extensive empirical support, is configural because the effective weight of each stimulus depends on the whole set. Other known configuralities (inconsistency discounting, redundancy discounting, and attentional dicounting) can also be interpreted in terms of the weight parameter of information integration theory.

An example is presented which shows that the picture of structure-of-intellect abilities cannot be derived merely from averages of correlation coefficients.

Whereas traditional tests of personality involve the assessment of hypothesized personality constructs which, in turn, are used to predict overt behavior, the behavioral approach entails more of a direct sampling of the criterion behaviors themselves. In addition to requiring fewer inferences than traditional tests, behavioral assessment procedures are seen as being based on assumptions more amenable to direct empirical test and more consistent with empirical evidence. The available research findings on the comparative predictive ability of the 2 approaches similarly suggest that the behavioral orientation is a potentially useful approach toward the construction of assessment procedures that can more accurately predict human behavior.

To bring about feedback control of the speech musculature, the higher neural centers should be kept constantly aware of (a) spatial position, (b) direction of movement, and (c) rate of movement of the articulators. The feedback mechanisms existing within the tongue that can mediate such dynamic space-time information are described. The unique 3-dimensional arrangement of the lingual muscle-spindle network is structurally organized to operate as a built-in geometric reference system. This network is capable of signaling higher brain centers as to the changing length, position, and rate of movement of the tongue during the articulatory motions of human speech. The short-latency, cervical dorsal root pathway conducting hypoglossal afferent information is described as well as the cortical projections of this complex rapidly-acting feedback system. The implications of these neurophysiological findings support a phonetic target-oriented theory of speech production. Neural receptors provide essential information regarding the moment-to-moment state of the speech system so that relatively invariant ends can be achieved despite the mechanical phonetic variability characterizing coarticulation.

In view of the numerous factors, comparison of different studies is often difficult because of confounding. In terms of the factors listed above, (a) patterning changes, in which signals are not changed but merely rearranged in order of presentation, suffer more than do tasks involving the detection of new signals or the recognition of different signals; and (b) discrimination tasks requiring recognition suffer more than do tasks requiring only the detection of a new signal.

CNV appears as a negative shift in the EEG base line that averages approximately 20 MUV. A 2-process theoretical model is proposed to account for CNV results: magnitude of CNV is positively and monotonically related to attention and nonmonotonically (inverted U) related to arousal level. CNV is also associated with other kinds of electrophysiological activity, notably autonomic functions and slow cerebral potentials that accompany voluntary motor movements. Although CNV is clearly a cerebral phenomenon, eye movements can seriously distort its measurement.

The model may be so specified as to manifest spontaneous activity and local activity variations based upon excitation of associated contents; this explains context effects and other features. Retrieval, in the model, is effected by means of organized retrieval cues and complex information-retrieval strategies, which later permit the model to respond to cues differing from the original stimuli.

For whatever reason or reasons, ss attached to the bogus device appear much more ready to express negative affect in experimental settings where one might normally expect the inhibition of such feelings, E.g., toward negroes and the physically handicapped.

Several alternative measures, including some that are widely used in the literature, are reviewed and their inadequacies discussed. The various measures are compared using data obtained from a simulated experiment and a previously published developmental study. It is concluded that (a) the measures differ widely in the magnitude of effects they yield; (b) alternative measures tend to accept the null hypothesis when the z score indicates a significant difference; and (c) certain measures are biased to increase solely as a function of longer recall list lengths.

Conclusions of a previous review are confirmed in that the thinking processes of deaf children and adolescents are found to be similar to hearing ss. It is noted that with few exceptions persons profoundly deaf from birth are severely deficient in linguistic skills in spite of many years of schooling; verbal processes could therefore not account for the emergence of cognitive skills even where developmental lags were noted. Occasional failures on certain logical tasks could be attributed to an unfavorable environment, E.g., in culturally different groups.

Subsequent research, largely of an analog variety, is then evaluated with particular respect to the adequacy with which natural psychotherapy conditions have been approximated. It is argued that the extensive laboratory research has not increased understanding of the original phenomena and that the analog studies constitute a case of premature simplification, since the original clinical research provided an insufficient basis for the interaction hypothesis.

It is argued that the multitrait-multimethod design yields the best evidence for investigating these issues. An analysis of variance model with computational formulas for the sums of squares and variance components based on the correlation matrix is proposed for the multitrait-multimethod situation. Using this model, data from 2 studies are examined and compared, relative to convergent and discriminant validity, method bias (halo), and error variance. It appears that this model and the indexes derived from it provide a more simplified and interpretable technique for analyzing and summarizing multitrait-multimethod data. A procedure to improve performance ratings based on partitioning the original matrix is illustrated with an example from the larger data set. (37 ref.)

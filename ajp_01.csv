A reconstruction procedure in which a spatial framework was provided during test trials, was used in those studies. In order to extend the generality of those findings, a position judgment procedure was used in the present experiments; subjects estimated ordinal position of each item following each of six study trials in which the 12 CVC items were displayed in a fixed sequence. That to-be-learned sequence was defined temporally in Experiment 1, which failed to corroborate prior findings, but was presented simultaneously and spatially in Experiment 2, which did. Interpretation focused on conditions necessary for finding homologous effects for supplied anchors and isolating stimuli, suggesting that absolute judgment can be regarded as a special case of serial learning, and vice versa, and on circumstances allowing utilization of an isolating stimulus as an organizational device.",,"article; human; learning; recall; vision; Humans; Mental Recall; Serial Learning; Verbal Learning; Visual Perception",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Lippman, L.G.",,,,,,,,00029556,,,"7212134","English","Am J Psychol",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0019271589

In the first experiment, subjects were given either forced or free choice acquisition to a common acquisition criterion. Then, their aversion was extinguished under either the free or forced choice procedure. The results of the first study showed that the greatest resistance to extinction was produced with a forced acquisition and free extinction procedure and the least resistance was produced by a free acquisition and forced procedure. Experiment 2 employed an equal number of acquisition trials (one or three) under either free or forced acquisition followed by either free or forced extinction. The results of Experiment 2 found that resistance to extinction was greater with three compared with one acquisition trial, but the acquisition technique did not influence resistance to extinction. As in the first experiment, extinction was more rapid with forced extinction. It appears that the strength of a taste-illness association is primarily dependent on the number of CS-US associations. Thus, when a common criterion is used, forced subjects take longer to extinguish their aversion due to their stronger taste-illness association. When an equivalent number of pairings is used, extinction rats are equal in free and forced animals (even though acquisition intake was higher in forced animals).",,"lithium; animal; article; avoidance behavior; drinking; drug effect; female; rat; reinforcement; taste; Animals; Avoidance Learning; Drinking; Extinction, Psychological; Female; Lithium; Rats; Taste",,"lithium, 7439-93-2; Lithium, 7439-93-2",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Mikulka, P.",,,,,,,,00029556,,,"7212131","English","Am J Psychol",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0019250446

The label-retrieval effect can be attributed to actual rehearsal of pictorial information and not to item selection. In addition, the beneficial effects of label retrieval did not vary with the informational content of the label itself, i.e., its power to distinguish between same-photo and same-scene items. However, the effects of label-type as well as label retrieval varied with recognition test instructions. In a ""scene"" recognition test, requiring recognition of both same-photo and same-scene items, effects of label-type were stronger than in the ""photo"" test, while effects of label retrieval were not significant.

Studies in which homographs were used to produce a change in meaning were reviewed with the conclusion that when appropriate controls are used the effects are too small to support meaning as a major factor underlying recognition. An experiment using homographs verified the general conclusion from previous studies. A review of studies was then undertaken to determine the influence of synonym distractors on recognition scores. If word meaning is critical in word recognition, the use of synonyms of study words as new words on the recognition test should produce large decrements.

If the locational information is specified before the word is displayed (e.g., it is always the first letter), but if the locational information is presented along with the display (e.g., the target position is underlined) reaction time is considerably slower. A model of the identification process was described which assumed that subjects first identify the word, then analyze the contents of all the letter positions in order to encode each letter. Finally, the identification can occur when subjects shift their attention to the target location. If the locational information is given before the display, the attention shift can occur as the letter positions are being analyzed and encoded, but the shift must be delayed until after the analysis if the locational information is part of the display. An implication of the model is that prior to identifying the contents of the target position, the subject should always have an encoding of all the letters in the word, and the results of the third experiment supported that expectation.",,"article; association; attention; depth perception; human; pattern recognition; perceptive discrimination; reaction time; vision; Attention; Cues; Discrimination (Psychology); Form Perception; Humans; Reaction Time; Space Perception; Visual Perception",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Johnson, N.F.",,,,,,,,00029556,,,"742661","English","Am J Psychol",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0018012919

However, careful reading of the literature suggests that, contrary to the Ornstein and Priestly models, a linear correlation between stimulus complexity and time perception should not be expected to fully describe the range of possible relationships. What researchers appear to have ignored is the interrelated impact on time perception of the widely reported inverted-U effects of stimulus complexity and the conceptually related dimension of extroversion. With these latter considerations, comparative time perception thus becomes not a linear but rather a curvilinear, U-shaped function of both personality and stimulus complexity dimensions. The conceptual reconciliation growing out of the present literature review thus offers an explanation for previously reported empirical inconsistencies and suggests the redirection of future comparative time perception research.",,"attention; auditory stimulation; decision making; extraversion; human; personality; photostimulation; review; time perception; Acoustic Stimulation; Attention; Choice Behavior; Extraversion (Psychology); Humans; Personality; Photic Stimulation; Time Perception",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Hogan, H.W.",,,,,,,,00029556,,,"369398","English","Am J Psychol",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0018009554
